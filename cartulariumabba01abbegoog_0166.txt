the next charter Roger de Argentom‚ the grantor, speaks 011110 father 00
Roger fitzPeter, and not as William fitaRobert, as, according 10 the 11101110-
randum, he must have been. Consequently the Roger 01 N 0. 72 must be 0
member 01 another 11011011 01 the family. In No. 217 0 Roger de Argentom
quitolaims to the Abbey certain small portione 01 land 01 Uplium which 110
thus describes :--“illam terram quam Juliana, uxor Will. de Argentom‚
nomine dotis de domo de Wyteby aequisivit 1110111111 (1110111111 bovatsmm
quas will, de Argentom‚ maritus ejusdem Julianus, dedit Deo et 11001. (10
Wyteby.” This William is 01 course the William fituRobert 01 the present
01101101, and the Roger who grants 1110 said No. 217 could hardly speek 01
him as he does if any very near relationship existed. It may be open to
question, however, whether the Roger de Argentum 01 the charter immedi-
ately preceding No. 217 10 identicol with the Roger 011110 101101, 01 theson
01 William litzRobert. Among the witnesses 10 Νο. 217 010 Gregor. de
Argentine and Joh. de Argentine, the former being 0100 0 witness to No. 72.

Argentom‚ distinguished 00 (10 Ketton, is mentioned in three consecutive eher-
tsrs, having two daughters, Amioia and Agnes, his eo-heiresses, owning pro·
perty 111 Ugthorp; and, again, in three other charters 0111. narb, aGregL de
Argentom is named owning property 111 Ugthorp, who describes himself 000
nephew 01 a Richnrd de Argentom‚ but his fether's name is not mentioned His
wife's 1101110 was J 11110110. But it is not possible to identify the one Gregory
with 'the other; indeed it is more 1110101110 they are father and son. There
is, besides, on f. 333 01 the 001110 urs. 0 001100 01 charters by Williem de
Argentum 01 such 0 nature 00 111 pert 10 discredit 110425. In 1110101101
Roger (10 Argentom‚ son 01 William, son 01 Robert, is ‘stated tc have 1011
three daughters, co-heiresses,—Agnes, Asmoto, and Elisabeth—the second
01 whom, Asmota, wss espoused to Albert de Crawcestre,—“de quibus
exierunt Yvo et Jacobus qui obierunt sine prole.” However, in the third 01
the charters just referred 10, Will. de Argentum makes lmown ‘⁴ omn horni-
nibus suis et amicis, Franoigenis et Anglicis . . . me d. 01 0. 0100111. Alberto

end, and Williem. The latter died ap, but Yvo had issue Jacobns, who
0100 appears to have died childless. Besides the above ohellsnge 01 Albert
de Crawcestre's wife Christiana as his sister by Willianr de Argentom‚
Albert's son Yvo is distinctly styled his nephew. The memorandum is
therefore undoubtedly wrong 0010 the 1101110 11011010, and 0011 only he right
0010 the person 0111110 supposition 11101 the three co·heiresses he mentions
became so on the death, without issue, of their brother william. But the
entire question 01 the mutual relationship 01 these Argentoms, and 01 their
connection with the 111010 famous and somewhat later family, 01 which sir
Giles was so conspicuous 0 member, is utterly obscure. Itis 1101 quite wide
