xiv INTRODUOTORY CHAPTERS.

For myself, 011000 good deal 01 patient investigation be-

' stowed upon the derivation 01 the place-names 01 the district,

I have no doubt that the first clement in the nemeis what so
large a majority 01 the prefixes in our local nomenclatura
clearly are, and that is the name 01 0 person. Such a name

, existed in the eleventh century, in the form 01 an agnomen or

nickname—Mr. Freeman 00110110 00000000-10 the 0000 01
Edric Streone, and we find it as 0 prefix in the name Streon-
bercht, wbioh occurs in the Liber Vitae. Butes to the meaning
of the suffix, that is clearly uncertain. There can be little
doubt, however, that -beolot, -ltolob, or -bale, is the true form,
and I look upon the forms -ltolt, 1001110010, quoted by
Young, as merely worn forms, or, in other words, forms from
whioh the c has dropped out by usage. While, from the occur-
rence 01 the same suffiri in a local name met with in some
early documenta contained in the Whitby Chartulary in the
twofold forms aaa, -halef,¹I am inclined 10 think that the
final 01 was dealt with in pronunciation precisely 00 11 was-
and is-in other words in which it is found3 and I specify
Old Anglien 90001, which is printed “ grudge '' in our Prayer-
book version 01 the Psalms, and is sounded yowff in the Clave-
land vernacular.2 And if this be so, it 10 as nearly certain 00
000 be that there may be a close connection, if 001 0 perfect
identity‚ between the -10101 10 Bede's “streanaeshalch” and
the word 01 such common occurrence in North Britain, which
10 written by Jamieson 100010, Mart, 1000011, and sounded
nearly 00 teaff is.

And in support 01 this view I would remark that the name
streanaeshalch 00 Streoneshalo was, beyond 011 doubt, applied
to the 0110 01 the Monastery-that is, to the level space
environed 00 two sides by the steep precipices of the 011110
whereon Hilda’s “Holy house ’' undoubtedly stood For there
is no question that, at the period 01 Domesday‚ Whitby-then
written Witebi-and Prestebi were two distinct places. In-
deed, soke 01 the latter appertained to the Manor 01 Witebi.
