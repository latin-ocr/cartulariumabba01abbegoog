xlii INTRODUCTORY OHAP'PERS.

It is important to notice the correspondence-coinoidenoe

almost—as to all material points between the two accounts so ’
far collated. For they araboth nearly, though not quite,
equally ancient, and, as it would appear, independent. 01 *'
course it is possible that the Whitby scribe may have seen and -
peruaed Symeon’s History, but it is by no means incumbent ι
011 us to assume it as probable. There is certainly nothingin '
the Memorial to suggest such a probability3 and, moreover, ἰ
assuming the earliest date alleged for the composition 01 110 ἐ
History, and the latest for the penning 01 the Memorial‚ still '
the interval is only short. Besides all which, the transactions '
· recorded in the former had taken place not so long before that .
the recollection 01 them in their very birthplace and theatra -
was likely to have become dim, or the memory of their recitet 1
10 require refreshing from the stores 01 another man's know· 3
ledge, who, at the most, besides not being an eye-witness hin·
seli, could scarcely have been much more than a generatim
nearer the time of their happening.

To resume 2-The Whitby Memorialist goes on to say that
Beinfrid carne to William de Perci, who gave him theold
Monastery 01 St. Peter and two carucatas of land in Prestebi,in
perpetual alms, the former being in much the same state 01 ruin
as that described by Symeon in the case of Jarrow-nothing
left, that is, but roofless walls and unsheltered altars. Reiu-
frid, however, diligently and patiently availing himself of the
means at his disposal, succeeded within a short time in gather-
ing about him a band 01 pious and prudent men as ready as
himself to adopt the monastic habit and submit to monastic
discipline under his immediate rule as Prior3 and after several

once, under the older name 01 Streoneshalh, tha holy housa 01 Hild, tha
daughter 01 the Bretwalda Oswin. From Whitby sprung another famous
house3 under the care oi Earl Alan, and under the government 01 11111111

Abbey of Saint Mary without the walls 01 York.’' It will be obser-ved 11111
Mr. Freeman in aver-y case adopts the true spelling of the personal namus
involved-Regenfrith‚ Ealdwine, AEllwina Oswiu, in place 01 Reinlrid or
1101111111, aldoin, Ellwy, Oswy. In abach which islittla mora than atm-
soript 01 charters it may be better to adhere to tha forms which 110111 ara
found in them, indicating from time to time, as 00011101 may crisa, the 11111
