PRELIMINARY NOTIOE ΤΟ ΤΗΕ READER.

In editing the present book it was possible to procecd on
one oi two, or even three, different principles or plens. In the
Whitby copy no order of time whatever is observed by the old
transcribere, and, as noted in the Preface, order oi locality or
place is only partially regarded. Order of place is more care-
l'ully attended to in the Museum copy, but still by no means
without noteworthy or extensive exceptione. · Order of subject,
again, is not too cerefully regarded in either copy. Royal con-
firmatione are by no means all brought together, neither are
Archiepiscopal or Papel confirmations. Even the charters
by the various membcrs oi the Percy family are scattercd
about in various parts cf the collection. An entire rearrange—
ment of all the charters and other documenta according to date

was, in the case of a series, the majority of which could only be

inferentially or approximately dated, obviously so arduous an
undertaking as to be practically impossible.¹ An entire re-
orrangement‚ cn the principle cf grouping together all the
documenta connected with the several different localities con-

¹ This is the principle on which Charlton has proceeded in his dealings
with tho contente ol the Whitby copy. A very small measure ol acquaint-
ance with the subject-matter ol his book is quite sufficient tc disclose the
eminently unsatisfactory results ol his arbitrary mode ol alleging the more
or less specilic dates of the various documents as they come under hand.
