Perci's demesne, the remainder (whether four carucatas or six)
is specifically St. Hilda's land and ol the fee of William de
Perci.

How long this had been the case there is of course no means
01 ascertaining‚ so far as the Domesday Record itself is con-
cerned; the fact remains nevertheless: and assuming the date
alleged in the Stephen narrative to be a prohable one—which
I think it may he affirmed to be by the common assent ol all
writers on the subject—and that the first donation followed
hard 011 Reinlrid’s initiatory proceedings at Whithy, we have
but a period of seven or eight years to assign as the period ol
possession previously to the Domesday inquiry.1 Beyond all
question, however, the grant of the two carucatas at Haclrness
hythe King—and these of course must be the two in 101001
the Walesgrif manerium-must have been made subsequently
10 the year 1086, and thus, I tlrink,a date approximate to
within a few months, is arrived at for the Royal grant, of the
specified lands at Hackness‚ N ordfeld and Briniston. For, 110111

the considerations already advanced, and which appear to me
10 be 01 such a natura as to be altogether conclusive, it is
entirely apparent, first, that the charter in which the gift of the

¹ There is another consideration tending to show that the monastic con·
necticn of Haclrness, and especially through the church of St. Peter there,
was 0110 01 old and long-continued standing. In the charter of confirmation
granted by William de Percy, son 01 Alan de Percy, and grandson of
William de Percy (Ova les gernuns, the Reiounder) (N o. 26), aiter the men·
tion ol Haclranessa and the Ohurch 01 St. Mary 111 the sams vill, we find
the further mention cf “the Ohurch oi St. Peter, with all its appurtenances ”
confirmed with the intent that “certain monks ol the aforesaid church 01
Whitby may continuously sojourn there, and serve ch and St. Hilda
prayingfor the sonls'’ specified at the beginning ol the charter. And on
examinatior this clause is seen to be a rehearsal, almost verbatim, ofa
clause in the charter of William de Percy, thc founder, where it stands “et
Portum l ) 01 Hachanessam, et ecclesiam S. Mariae ejusdem villae, et
eccl. S. Petri, curn omn. pert. suis, ut jam dicti monachi de Wyteby in
pace sint et orent pro animabus praenominatis.'’ The presumption certainly
11, not that the Ohurch oi St. Mary was a later grant, which we 1111011 11 was,
but that it was a grant in augmentaticn ol an existing monastic foundation
of less recent date. 11 may be here noted, too, that after the word
‘ ‘ Portum ’' in the preceding extract there is an erasure, on which nc subsc·
quent insertion has been made ς and that the words “in pace’' are written
in red 11111, a peculiarity not met with in any other part of the volume.
