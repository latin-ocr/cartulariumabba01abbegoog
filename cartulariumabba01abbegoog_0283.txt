carucate ol land, on certain conditione (somewhat curious in themselves), father·
Robert de Brus, Agnes his wiie, Adam his elder¹ son, William son ol the
latter, and Robert de Broc, J uvenis, being among the witnesses. The latter,
11 well as William de Brus, Adam's 101, is a grandson 01 Robert (11 Brus,
then of Danby, the founder of Gysburne, and this lact throws the date of
the charter towards the latter part 01 Robert’s lile, or to about the time
alleged by Oharlton. The present charter brings both Alan de Ferlington
and his father Radulfus into connection with Wilton 11 lords thereos—the
alienated tithes were the tithes 01 the “dominium ;” and beyond doubt their
connection with Wilton originated in their connection, as sub-feudatories,
with the Fossards, who held of the Earl 01 Mortain, not only at Wilton but
at Bulmer, Ferhngton, Welburne, Lilling, etc, and were succeeded by 1111
Mauleys in the seignory. As to the descent and connection oi the Bulmers
and Ferlingtons‚ in a Quo Warranto Roll 01 21 Edw. 1., is a record 01 1 suit
in which John de Bulmer is plaintiff, and the Prior of Helagh Park defendant,

Wilton, identified as brother of Stephen de Bulmer, the great-grandfather 01
John de Bulmer, 101 ol John (11 Bulmer, who, as “consanguineus et haeres,”
succeeded to the Wilton inheritance 01 the (1100111 ol Thomas de Wilton (1

Radulfus ((11 Bulmer) de Ferlington, father ol the grantor ol this charter,
presumably by his wife Anfrida, and also 01 Stephon (11 Bulmer, immediate
ancestor of the future John de Bulmer de Wilton. Alan de Ferlingtom the
