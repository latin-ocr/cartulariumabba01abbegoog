by Stephen, and on the suggested motivas, himself being more-
over a man possessed ol temporal weight and influenoe, a
possible and much more than merely plausible explanation is
suggested not only as to the actual foundation of the alleged
varianae, or rather hostility, between William de Perci and
Stephen, but also as to the subinieudation of 1111 latter 1ο the
former at Prestebi and Sourebi. lt is clear 11111 Stephon
possessed influence enough to obtain a grant from the King
111 capite 11 two carucatas 11 Lestingham and two more 11
Apeltun. It may be, perhaps is probable, that these granta
were obtained iu transitu, so to speak, between Whitby and
York, and that on his translation 1ο York as Abbot 11 the
infant House of St. Mary, they were continued and confirmed to
him in that character ; and also that William de Perci, oontem-
poraneously with his acquisition 11 the said granta, may have
seen good reason to constitute him his own feudatory at
Whitby, to the extent and in the way indicated by the Domes-
day returns.1

The Lestingeham entry is noteworthy. There can be no doubt 111111111
construction l have put upon it 111111 correct one, forthere is one precisely
similar on 1111 following page, vias-“In Wnsronn (Wnsrannrne) habuit
'l'orbrand v 111. t’rae ad geldam. Nunc habet Berengarius ibi iiii villanos
cum i caruca, etc.” But it is 1ο be remarked that in the Recepitulation,
on p. lxxxivb, 1111 entry touohing Lestingham is, “ln Lestingham ii ear.

previous enumerationes the various manors, etc, comprised in 1111 several
