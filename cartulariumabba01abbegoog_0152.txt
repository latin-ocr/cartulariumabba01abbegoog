“baseless labric’' indeed. Charlton (p. 135) says-“As 111 the (lhurch ol
Saxeby, mentioned in the foregoing 11111111, . . . Iam 11111111 conclude
that we 11111 look 111 Saxeby in South Fyling3 1111 what confirma me in
this opinion is, the foundation 111 church or chapel having only a few years

ago been dug up there on the demesne landa 11 Sir Charles Hotham, Bart.‚
situata in a field or garth called the Chapel-garth . . . whichI am pretty
confident is the very place given to Whitby Abbey in the above charter.’'
Young (p. 376, note) commenting 111 this, writes—“Charlton’s idea that
Saxeby was in south Fyling, where there was a field called crepa-qaam on
the Hotham estates, is by no means improbable, only we must suppose, in
that case, that Saxeby Ohurch was suppressed by our monke, being never
otherwise mentioned. Still I am more inclined to reclron this church, as
well as Flemesburg, the same with Fyling.'¹ No lengthy commenta are
required in connection with these remarks. There is no uncertaimty as to
the place where Saxeby is to be looked 111. The rubricated heading 11 the
present charter, by its explicit notification, “de Sudfilinga,''settles that
question at once. Saxeby is in South Fyling 11 nowhere, and 11 11 were
otherwise, Fleinesburg cannot be torturcd into Flemesburg. That (111111-
ton’s supposition as 11 the site 11 Saxeby Ghurch or Chapel is well founded
is nearly certain. The position, the foundations, and the name 11 the site
all lend confirmation 1ο 11, and it may further be noted that the site is hard
by Kirk Moorgate, and that Kirk Moor comes close up to the enclosurc
named Chapelgarth (Ο. Map, No. 46, 111-1111111111.) The idea 11 “ sup
pression,” started and repeated by Young,is grataritous. Probably twenty
or thirty chapels in Oleveland have disappeared precisely in the same way
as Saxeby Chapel has, some 11 which have had a very distinct history, but

11111111 which now have more memorial than the names 11 their sitos,

Ghlapel Field, Chapel Garth, Chapel Hill, and so 111111.
