xc PRELIMINARY N orlon TO -ΤΗΕ READER.

cenred, would have amounted, in its execution, to the dc facto

breaking up of both copies into a series of fragments, and

reuniting thern with an arbitrary tie, with the result of de-
stroying the identity of either copy. Rearrangement on the
principle of juxtaposition of documenta of like character seemed
open, on the same grounds, to a similar objection. The Editor,
therefore, after mature deliberation, deerned it best to print the
Whitby copy as it stands, following it up with the additional
documenta obtained from the Museum copy in due sequence,
and with those obtained from other sources next in succession,
numbering them all in order, and by aid of these numbers in
every case referring the reader to those documenta which in
any way belonged to the same group. And, on the whole, it is
hoped that this mode will be found on experience to have all
the advantages of either of the others adverted to above, so
far aa feasible, without tho corresponding drawbacks or disad-

vantages.
