also the counsel and aid of the wise and picus Bishop Trum-
wine, who took refuge at Streoneshaloh when driven from his

own district by the inroads of the Picts, and other Northem

- enemies Her death took place in the fifty-ninth year of her

age, and consequently in the year 713.

After the death of AElfleda a blank in the history of Streon-
eshaloh occurs, so complete, that during a period of a century
and a half no record at all of its work or progress-or, it might
well be eventually, according to an apparent law in such
matters, of its falling off and deolension-is known to have
existed. It seems strange that such should be the state of tho
casa, for we have the amplest assurance from the bare outline oi
facts already stated, that a period ol extraordinary diligenoe and
activity in the special work of a Seminary of Ecclesiastical
learning and discipline had, as of necessity, witnessed the rear-
ing of asucoession of devoted and able men, rising one after
another to poste of the highest dignity and importance. Indo·
pendently of the accessions to the number and influence of the
inmates of the Monastery which would be made in such cases as
thatofBishopTrumwineandhisattendants--quitepossiblyaby
no means singular case in those days—there must have been a
large body of duly taught and trained men there, long aster
AElfleda’s deoease; and it seems hard to believe that no ono
among them all should have been found willing a ndable, and
even zealous, to chroniole the annals of his House. But so it
seems to be. If any record was kept, the writings were lost or
destroyed, and we hear no more of Streoneshaloh until wo hear ⁴
of it in its ruin under the incursion of the Danes. The accounts
given of the destruction of the Monastery, and the attendant
ravages in the adjacent district, by tho different annalista who
record the circumstances, are not altogether consistent; and
, they consequently need close silting and comparison if we seek
to elicit the truth. For this there is no space here, and we
must be contented with the bare statement, that from about
867 -870 theplaoe was laid waste, and the desolation of the once
‘¹ Holy House” was a lasting one. “Streoneshalhss’ says Young,
“lay desolate for 207 years.’'

But I think we must be carelul to limit the force of this ex-

pression as in our last sentence. The Streoneshalh which “lay
desolate'' was merely the once “Holy House” or Monastery,
