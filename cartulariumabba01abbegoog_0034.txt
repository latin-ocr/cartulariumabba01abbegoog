INTRODUOTORY caAPrERs. xxvii

under the Norman occupatiori 161 the restoration 61 the one-
time famous Religiom House 61 Eastern Oleveland Reinfrid
is named as the first restorer, and then as the first Prior 61 the
restored House. He isdescribed in the Memorial as having
been an active soldier in the Conqueror’s service—“ miles
strenuissimus in obsequio domini sui Willelmi Nothi, Regis
Anglorum '’-and as having turned sside from the direct line of
6 journey, or march, through Nerthumbria in order to visit
Whitby, where 116 was struck with compunction at 1116 sight 61
the desolation caused by the ravagas 61 “the merciless pirates,
Ingwar and Ubba, leaders 61 the Danas.'' Thereis a species 61
suppression here which is rather amusing. Domesday also
speaks 61 the desolation caused in and near Whitby, under the
ravages 61 6 leader 61 the N ormana, and it says 61 28 6611166166,
averaging probably 100 acres each, “pene omnia wasta ’'-the
only exceptions being the Ohurch-lands held by the Abbct 61
York in Prestebi and Sourebi. It may 11616 been a tacit 6611-
sciousness on the part of the memorialist which held his pen,
making him feel that it might be quite as well to leave the
immediate authors 61 the nearer, or more recent, wasting
unusmed. Nay, it may very well be, 61611, that Reinfrid
himself-“ strenuissimus miles in obsequio domini sui ''-—knew
only too much about the ravagas 61 the Conquerar, and might
have good personal reason 161 compunctior. Any way, he
1166111116 6 monk 61 Evesham, and there was well trained in
monastic practice and discipline. After a space he returned
into N orthumbria with the clearly conceived design 61 reviving
monastic religion there, and, coming eventually to William de
Perci, was well received by him, and put into a favourable
position for carrying out his plens by a grant at that baron's
hands 61 “the ancient monastery 61 S. Peter the Apostle,
together with two carucatas of land in Prestebi, as 6 perpetual
alme? In no long time several others, like-minded with him-
self, were collected together, and the new Abbey, in some sense
61 other, became 61661. 1116 precise date ο1 the commenced
restoration isnct known ; but, according to Dr. Young, it could
not be laterthan10783 161 “ in that year Reinirid was joined
. by cns Stephen, who afterwards became Abbct 61 York, and is
5{usually called Stephon 61 Whitby, because Whitby was the
{place at which he began the monastic life.” ·
