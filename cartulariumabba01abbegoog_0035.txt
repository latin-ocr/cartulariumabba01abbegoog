xxviii INTRODUOEORY OHAPTERS.

But, speaking plainly, the history of matters connected with ’
the restoration of Whitby at this time isamuddle. The account
given in the Memorial is inconsistent with, and in parts con·
tradictory of, that left by Stephen of Whitby; while the Domes-
day statement that the two carucatas in Prestebi and Sourebi
were held by the Abbot of York of William de Perci (the latter
holding all Whitby of Hugh Earl of Ohester) is hard to accom-
modate with either account. What can be attempted towards
apossible reconciliation has been attempted in the second ol
these Introduetory Chapters, to which therefore the render ⁴
must from this point be referred

This, however, may be said: that it seems very doubtful
whether, at the date alleged—nearly coincident with that ol
the Domesday returns—there was much living or actual mon·
astio work going on at Whitby at all. The residenca of the
monastic party would seem to bave fluctuated between Whitby ‘
and Hackness, to say nothing of Stephen's mention of Iasting·
ham as at one time a resting-place or refuge3 and it was not
until sometime after Serlo de Perci, brother of William de
Perci “hote Iesgernuns,'' had become Prior, that Whitby
became in reality the monastic head-quarters From this tina
forth the growth of the Abbey in material means, and it isa ,
be presumed also in the accretion of the necessary buildings
became steady, and eventually rapid and very considerable ,
Passing by the obscure transaction of the alleged original grant
at Prestebi and Sourebi, the more certain grantes the Ohumb
of St. Peter at Whitby, with all its appurtenances, by Hugb
Earl oi Chester, and (by the same charter) the grant of the
Ohurch of Midlesburg with its tithes French and English-
passing all this by, we find the grant by William de Percito
his brother Serlo of the vills of Whitby and Stainseker, ol
Newham and Stakesby, of Hakaness and the Portos Whitby,
and of the Ohurches of St. Mary and St. Hilda at Hackneas,
together with Northfield, Suffield, Everley, Brochesay, and
Thornley, with the tithes also oi Uplethum, Wilton, Ohever·
mund, Ludeford, Covenham, Immingeham, Sumerledeby, sema,
with half the fishery of Ergum, and all foreste, woodo, wetere,

eta, belonging to the said Ohurch of Whitby ; and, theream,
gilt and confirmation from Alan de Perci, son of William afore
