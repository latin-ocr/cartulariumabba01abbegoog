l INTRODUOTORY CHAPTERS.

his deed of gift was known to either Oharlton or Young, stili
the charters of confirmation by later monarcha made it certain
that such a charter existed. A copy of it is given in No. 57 9,
and it will he noted that, in the first place, the King confirms
“Ecclesiae S. Petri et S. Hildae de Prestebi etde Witebi et
Serloni de Perci, Priori de Witebi, et monachis, etc.'’ similar
rights and privileges to those of Beverley, Ripon and York;
the Port, with wreck, etc.; full and free dominion over all their
possessione3 all the donatione of William de Perci‚ founder of
the monaste1y3 the remissiori of Denegeld on the lands of
royal gift in Hackness, Nordfeld and Bumiston ; and then,
lastly, he bestows the church of All Saints in Fishergate, York,
“ad abbatiam constituendam, cum soca et saca et toll ct
team et infangenetheof, etcum omn. pert. suiset cum omn
libertatibus quas meae propriae abbatiae habent, ut ibi monaehi
libere, et in pace, die ac nocte, Deum deprecentur pro me et pro
haer. meis, Regibus Angliae.’'1

While reserving the character and quality of the benefac-
tione specified in the oharters so far noticed for fuller considera-
tion in the sequel, it may not be inexpedient here to give a few
moments' thought to one circumstance in connection with them
which appears to demand attention Ι mean that, while the
historioal statements before us mention Reinfrid as applying to
William de Percy, the charter actually conceded isconceded hy
Hugh of Chester. Probably it is enough to remark thatin
Domeaday William de Percyis named only as a sub-infeudatory

at Whitby of Earl Hugh (although a tenentia capita at Hach-
nessae it may be important to note), and that, of couneus

Omnium Sanctorum de Fishergate, cum omnibus pertinentiis suis, quam
dederat Serloni Priori et Monasterio de Witebi in elem perp, ea pactione
ut ibi monachi predicta Ecclesia Deo servirent, et pro eo orarent, et pro
haeredibus suis'’ And again ou the first paper leaf, (No. 384), “ Dotata est
Ecclesia monasterialis de Whitby, ex dono Willelmi Ruffi filii willelmi
Bastardi Regis Anglorum, in Eboraco ecclesiam Omnium Sanctorum da
Fishergate, cum omn. pert. suis, quam dederat Serloni Priori et Manna de
Whitby in elem perpetuam.”

¹ The existence and character oi this chartei· seems to add some foros a
a remark of Mr. Freeman’s :-“The fevv churches towards which Rufus
appears, not as a spoiler but as a benefactor, are those which owed their
foundation to hie father.''-(Nomce Gargana, v. 73.)
