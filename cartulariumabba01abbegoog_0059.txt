were only assenting in what they did to his oounsel and com-
mand, imposed the direction or government (“ procurationem '')
of the entire monastery on Stephen’s shoulders ; and, although

he manifested long-continued unwillingness und opposition,
eventually, and in obedience alike to the command 01 the King
and the two ArchbishopS, chose him-not tsimply for their
Prior, but—their Abbot.

Now, 011 'ther Symeon of Durham and the Whitby Memo-
rialist tare ut terly and entirely mist t'aken 1n their statements, 01
the alleged narrator of the abovet story is making mis· state
men ts: and, of course, if we look upon the narrator 00 0100
certainly the actor, inasmuch as he tells the story in the first
person, he makes them knowingly and purposely. He makes
Reinfrid go to J arrow to lead the life of a solitary. Symeon
states that he was not allowed 10 leave Evesham on any other

and Prior,'' 0 considerable number 01 monks, and habituated
thern to the rule of religione living. Notwithstanding which,
raw novioe 00 he, Stephen, was himself ; tried, practised,
trained, experienced as Reinfrid was, by his Evesham initia-
tion, by his maturer Jarrow endeavours and labours and
successes, by his still further continuance in the same toils and
cares at Whitby ; the whole brotherhood, with Reinfrid at their
head, and at lleinfrid’s suggestion and desire moreover, solioit
the former to become their head and ruler, and elect him not
simply into the place assumed to be vacated by Reinfrid, but
