¹ M. Ingelby. ² See note 16 No. 35.

³ These two last witnesses omitted in Μ.

⁴ This confirmation is word 161 word the same as in No. 269. The eon·
vention referred to in this documentis found in No. 205, aud as Abbot
1116116111 16 named as the Abbot 61 Whitby with whom the settlement in·
volved was made, and there were two successive Abbots 61 that 66166, viz.
Ric. de Burgh (11434175) and Ric. de Waterville (1171-6.1185(1)),1116
not at first sight apparent which of the two was the contracting partyin
this case. Probably, however, the mention 61 1161661, Clericus 61 the church
61 Iugleby, as still living, leads to the inferenoe that the Abbot Richard in
question is the former 61 the two so named, inasmuch as the said Reiner is
a witness to Guido de Balliol‘s original grant (No. 52), which it is reasonable
16 suppose preceded the year 1138, or at least could not be long subsequent
16 that date. Moreover, the fact that the convention with Evesham is men-
tioned in the Memor-iel (p. 5) is consistent with the assumption that it
took place during the incumbency 61 the first Abbot Richard, or at some
time antecedent to the year 1175. The date 61 the present deed is there·
fore somewhat thrown back-a conclusion which is quite consistent with
tho fairly certain approximate dates of the other benefactions named in this
confirmation.

⁵ Robertus de Botiveleiu died Dcan in 1186. Robert de Gaunt is named
just before him in Le Neve as Dean in 1148. It is certainly possible, there·
fore, and assuming the conclusion in the preceding note to be sound, that
this may be Robert de Gaunt.
