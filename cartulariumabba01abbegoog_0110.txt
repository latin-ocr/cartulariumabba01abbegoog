ency and quality. Ι1 anything, the ink is blacker and more glossy 1111116
Memorial than in the other two documenta under notice, though the seeming
difference may only depend upon the circumstance that the writing is mede
larger, and the spaces between the lines much wider in the 16111161 than 111,
the latter. On the whole, I 6111 inclined to think that possibly a space 61
a few years may have intervened between the penning 61 the larger writin g
611116 Memorial and 11161 61 the other two entries‚ as also that the latter
were written very closely upon the date that is last mentioned, namely, in
the year 1176. This would throw the writing 61 the Memorial back to
about 1155 16 1165, which is probably not 161 from the true date.

upper part 61 lb is the same as that on 1 8, and theuceforward with an
occasional blank page 61 1661, and a 1616 insertion or two, to the bottorn 61

1244.
