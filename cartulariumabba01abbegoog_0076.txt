the direct orders of the King, moreover, they migrated to
Lastingham.

But before proceeding to deduce any inferenoe from this-
frnm whatever point of view regarded—somewhat startling in·
consistency between this part of the alleged Stephen narrative
and the Domesday returns, it may be well to try and ascertain
whether disparity of date may be suggested as affording a pos-
sible explanation, whether more or less satisfactory 011555011-
able, of the said inconsistency.

The alleged Stephon states that in 1015, the twelfth year
of the Conqueror’s reign, he assumed the monkish habit at
Whitby3 that a few days after, as already noticed, he was
