existing there, and possessing lande and rights, than 10 suppose
the old connection between Whitby and Hackness had been
lost sight 01, 111 was 1101, 101 the first time since 869, recalled
to mind and acted on.

At least thus 111111111100111111111)1 clear—thatwhen Domes-
day was compiled there was land at Hackness which was
definitely the land of St. Hilda. The entry, among the lands
01 William de Perei, involving Hackness is as follows :—
“Mamnmn. In Hagenesse‚ et Sudfelt, et Evrelai sunt viii
carucatae terrae ad geldum, ubi possunt esse v carucae. Dc hac
terra sunt ii carucatae in soca Walesgrip; et aliae sunt de t'ra
S. Hildae. Nunc habet Willelmus ibi ii carucatas et xiiii
villanos, et 1111 bordarios cum iiii carucis. Ibi iii ecclesia et
presbiter. . . . . T. R. E. valebat vii libras, modo xx solidos.”
And in the summary at the end there is this further addition
10 the 111011111101 thus eonveyed :—“ In Sudfelt 11 Evrelag,’'
held by Willia'm de Perci, were “vi carucatae,’' and in “Hag-
enesse iiii carucatae.'' The sum thus given is ten carucates ¹
as against eight specified in the earlier entry. But without
troubling ourselves with the question whether the discrepancy
isdue to a mistake 01 the scribe, 01 10 some other cause, it is
clear that in 1086, while two carucatas are still in soke 01 the
Royal manerium 01 Walesgn'f, and two are in William de

as not only “Testes” but “Cenomanos'’ In the first case he grants the
church 01 St. Peter at Whitby, “et omnia quas ad eam pertinent,” which
grant 1 look upon as in part expanded and explained, as well ns confirmed,
bytho Obarter 01 William the Conquerar (Νο. 184); 101, besides the Pcrt
and its waters, forest and forest rights, a variety 01 other privileges and
liberties are named, only consistent with the possession 01 considerable
demaine and ecclesiastical endowments. In the second he confirma the
10111111 gilt, with fuller details as 10 what really and specially appertnined
10 the church 01 St. Peter, inclusive 01 the port, and with the addition 01
St Mary's Ghurch at Hackness, and a variety 01 tithes and other profits
elsewhere. And it is to be remarked in reference to “other sources 01
111011111101 01 deduction,’' that the memorialist speaks with entire precision
01 just two such periods 01 benefaction cn the part 01 William de Perei.
His words are: “Omnes terras, possessiones, forestas, ecclesias, decimas et
libertates quas saepenominatus idem Willelmus de Persi, cum Alano de
Perci filio suo, Monasten'o de Witebi dederat inprimis, necnon iu ultimis
temporibus ruia antequam Ierosolimam peteret.’' This last clause is im.
portant as going near to fix the date 01 the later and 1111111101111011.
