as Abbot, and that by the command of King and both Arch-
bishops alike.

But, setting aside the preposterousness of a statement such {pppirpho
as this in its various parts, and not least in its last part, espe- and what
cially taken in connection with the fact that the next superior fflJfrfgffffi
of the establishment, namely Serlo de Percy, was indisputably be assumas

Prior and not Abbot, it will be well to give a measure of regard ildulve
to the question es to who and what Reinfrid really was. Mr.
Freeman, in his brief notice of the revival of religion in the
North, speaks of Reinfrid or Regenfrith as “seeminglya lay-
brother,''l and adverte in a note to Symeon's description of
him as “ignarus litterarum,'' and on the next page goes on tc
say-“But Regenfrith, now we may presume no longer igno-
rant of letters, went forth as the reviver of the Monastery of
Whitby.'' In some way or other-perhaps owing to the mis-
conception so easily and unsnspectedly associating itself with
the phrase, “ an illiterata man ”-—the idea tacitly connected
with Reinfrid seems to be that he was a common sort of a
man, and, as a soldier, just what we should speak of now-a·
days as a “ common private,'’ or one of “the rank and file.” If
the Whitby Memorialist may be assumed to have really known
something of the man he speaks of as the first Prior of the
revived Monastery, he was neither a lay-brother nor a common
soldier. He describes him as “monachus de Evesham,”² and
as having been “miles strenuissimus in obsequio domini sui
Willielmi Bastardi;'' and moreover, with sufficient independence
of action to be able to turn acide to Whitby when on his road
—whether simply journeying or professionally menching-
through the province of Nerthumbria. Surely the least that
can be made of suche descriptionis that he was in some
sense or other a distinguished soldier, and in the direct service-
a personal follower-of the King himself, in contradistinction to
any other or meaner “lond'' Nc one who bears in mind the
nature and terms of military service in those days can suppose,
when such terms are employed, that he was other than “a man

monasticis disciplinis bene instruetus;” this is the account given in the
Memorial.
