INTRODUOTORY CHAPTERS. lxxvii

That Reinfrid died Prior I think there can be no reasonable
doubt whatever; that 80110 de Percy joined the Whitby 00111-
munity as a monk during Reinfrid's rule (the donation just
named being then made), seems to me equally little 0 1001101 01
doubt; and that on Reinfrid's death 80110 de Percy succeeded
10 the Priorate can scarcely be questioned. Nor can any great
space 01 11100 be allowed 101 the effecting 01 the said successions,
00 Serlo's name appears in both confirmations by the Conqueror.
But this fact testifies 1101 only in some measure as 10 the date
01 which 80110 must have become Prior, it speaks also in
intelligible terms as 10 the weight and influence already attach-
ing 10 the Monastery and its acknowledged head, independently
01 that belonging 10 the Founder, which no doubt would also be
employed in procuring such confirmations and grants. Nor is
it only thus that we are enabled to recognise the growing
importance 01 the Whitby Foundation and its Superior, for we
have other pregnant proofs 01 the same in important donatione
made to the Monastery, and Serlo as its Prior, hy men 01
consideration and importance. Such specially was the gift
by Uchtred de Alverstain, filius Gospatric (N 0. 108), 01 two
carucatas 01 land in Chaitun (Gayton), one of the witnesscs to
whose charter is 80110 himself ;1 and, 10 specify but one other
instance, that of Aaliza de Percy (nisce 01 the Founder and 01
80110) and her first husband, Η1130 de Boitorp.

Now, reference has been made at 0 former page to the distinct
statement 01 the Memorialist‚ that 80110 de Peroy continued in
the office of Prior until William de Percy, nephew 01 the F cunder,
was created Abbot, and to the possibility that this transaction
-regarded in the light 01 supersession 01 the uncle in favour
01 the nephew—might perhaps afford some measure 01 explana-
tion as 10 the alleged variance between William de Percy the
Founder and his brother, Prior 80110.

¹ Another witness is 0 man whose name 10 perhaps 1110 most remarkable
in the entire chartulam, as retaining its Scandinavian 101111 0001101011, 110,
Arne Grimssunc. The charter 10 0100 remarkable asestablishing a concession
on the part of the monks themselves, thus explaining the occurrence oi the
Prior’s name at the head 01 the other witnesses-“ concesserunt vero mihi
jamdicti monaehi ut sim frater predicti coenobii‚'’ fully and entirely, and
that the grantor shall be received and united to the Order whenever he may
come, and with whatever amount of property, “parva seu magna,'' he may
present himself.
