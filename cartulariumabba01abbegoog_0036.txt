INTRODUOTORY cHAPrnRs. xxix

said; from William de Perci, and from divers others, memhers
of the family of Perci, or connections of it by marriage, or sub-
feudatories3 and no less from a host of others in no way related
or connected with the family of the founder and patron, who
follow one another in rapid succession until at last, in Abbot
Roger's time (lara-44), the summit of wealth and prosperity
seems to have been reached.

A moment's pause here to note the fact that the port was
gIven hy William de Perci, the founder, to the Abbey in Prior
Serlo's time, and to remark-and Ithink there is ground for
calling attention to the fact after what we have above had
occasion to notice in connection with the money, and therefore
with the mercantile, importance of the port-that this was,
there can he no doubt at all, as weightya part as any of the
whole grant, at least potentially and in the future, if not
actually and at the time then present. It should be noted too,
that, what with Earl Hugh's grant and William de Perci's, no
small part of what was afterwards known as “ Whitby Strand,'’
and scemately defined by well-known meres and houndaries,
had already, before the year 1100, become the property of the

Abbey. There would be no deficiency then, even at this early
period, of means for carrying on whatever works might be
considered desirable.¹

¹ Perhaps more distinct reference should be made to the lact, adverted to
in note 6, p. 93, to No. 108, that as early as Prior Serlo’s times there was
11 Whitby au official whose style and title was “Magister Operis ejusdem
loci,” and to the inevitahle inference derivable from such a fact. Con-
structive work of a systematis character was of necessity being pushed
forwerd, and under the guidance and direction of a competent or scientific
designer and surveyor. 'l'his may also be the place for calling attention to
one noteworthy fact connected with the existing remains of the Abbey
chares That buildings oi early N orman date once existed, there can be no
question3 but the questions what were they, where were they, what became
oi them, are questions which may be asked-perhaps must be asked—but
cannot be answered. Indead, no attempt 11 answering them can now be
made. What may be regarded as 1 mere legend tells of a chapter-house as
existiug in early Norman times, but there is no tangible trace either of it or
any other structure of the same style. The east end of the existing ruined
charoli is the earliest part ol what is 1111, and it cannot be assigned to an
earlier date than the former hali of Abbot Roger's incumbency, and it is to
the point to observe that no examinatior, however close and carious, serves
