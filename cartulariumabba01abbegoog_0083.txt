King William’s confirmations the possessions of the renoscent
monastery, so far as we have any certainty, may be thus stated:
—The ancient monastery with its site, ruined oratorias, the
church of St. Peter, and two carucatas of land in Prestebi,
together with all things which appertained to the said church
of St. Peter3 the church of Midelsburg‚ with all its tithes
“ Francigenis et Anglicis ;” the church of St. Peter at Hackness‚
certain carucatas of land in the same vill, the number not quite
certain, of William de Perci's feo, two other carucatas, in the
same place, of the Royal demesnes‚ together with other carucatas
in Nordfeld, and two marein Burniston springing from the same
source, with all their various appurtenanoes‚ besides the rights
of sao and soke, and immunity from Danegeld; certain forests
and forest rights within their own peculiar limits3 the port ol
Whitby with its various rights ; and also, besides all'the various
ecclesiastical liberties and immunities like to those possessed
by the three great religious foundations of Beverley‚ Ripon
and St. Peter's at York, ,the fullest rights, liberties free
customs and immunities which the Royal power could bestow
in other matters.

Moreover‚ the mention made in William's charter touohing
the lands, forests and woodland beasts (“ silvestribus bestiis’')
“ intra terminos suos,’' andos the “aquae eorum in Portu de
Wyteby,'' lends some tangible significando to the statement made
by the Memorialist, that William de Perci, when the number
01 the monks continued to increase at Whitby, and his brother
Serlo had been made a monk there (“ibi monachus fuisset
effectus''), gave them “ villas, terras, ecclesias et decimas in perp.
elemosinam.'' The fact is so likely in itself, that, uncertain as
we are what were the then limits of the lands and other
possessions of the monastery, it is quite impossible to treat the
statement in question as a mere rhetorical effusion on the part
