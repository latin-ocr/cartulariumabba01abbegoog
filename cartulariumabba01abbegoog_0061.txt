liv INTRODUOTORY OHAPTERS.

under authority, having soldiers under him ;’' and that his rank
was not a very subordinate one there are other consideratione
tending to show.

For instance, his son1 was obviously a man of some distinc-
tion as well as wealth. Chariton himself makes him out to
have been Dapifer- that is, as he explains it, “ butler, or cup-
bearer ”-to the family of de Arcubus3 and this not only with
no better authority than the fact that he holds under Osbert
or Osbern de Arches (whose confirmation of his grant to
Whitby of two carucates in Tholestun is given in two separate
charters, Nos. 88 and 235),2 but in the face of adirect state-
ment to the contrary made in the body of the Memorial. To
myself, even in the absence of such direct statement, yet from
his frequent presence attha execution of important charters by
members of the Percy family, it would always have appeared
more probable that he was Dapifer to the head of that great
family, in other words to Alan de·Percy himself ; but the
questionis set at rest at once by the simple entry in the
Memorial just referred to-namely, “ex dono Folconii, Dapi·
feri Alani de Perci, duas carucatas terrac in Thoulestune.'’⁸

¹ Oharlton’s sagacity led him 10 infer that Fulco filius Raynfredi wasa
son of Reinfrid the Prior 11111110), p. 60), a fact that 10 placed quite beyond
doubt by the entry of his name in full as “Falco Dapifer filius Reynfridi
Prioris (10 Whitby” among the witnesses 10 two of the charters rehearsed
in the Inspeximus of Henricus filius Hem-ici (10 Percy, found ou f. 6 (or f)
in the Museum chartulary.

²The terms employed in the one (No. 88) are “concedente d’no mco
Osberto de Arches,'' and in the other (No. 253), “consensu 01 licentia d'ni
mei Osberni de Arches.” Touching the duplicate form of the name Osbcrt
or 0sbern, it may be noted that the same peculiarity is met with in 1110
Domesday record for Yorkshire. Thus, on p. ib (Facsimile copy), the form
Osbcrtns is met with; in the list of 1000, p. fib, it 10 Orbem, as it 10 also iu
the description of his fee, p. lxiii ct aeq„ and in the Clamores, p. lxxiv. In
No. 89 10 a further confirmation by William de Arches.

⁸ “In Toglestun et Neuueton et Oglestorp, habuerunt iiii taini . . . vii
carucatas terrae 01 vii bovatas. N unc habet Fulco, homo Osberni, ibi i carn·
catam 01 v villanos, cum i caruca 01 viii acras prati.

“In Neuton et Oglestun, habuerunt v taini iii carucatu m ad
galdum. Terra 001 ad iiii carneas. Ibi Fulcho, homo Othoni, habeti
carucatam 01 vii villanos, curn ii carncis, et xvi acras prah' 01 sectam i
molendini.”

These are the Domesday entries tonching the maneria in the fec of Osbern
