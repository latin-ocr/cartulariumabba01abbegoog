has its origin far back iu the remotest antiquity, but the use of it as a
geographical expression is discoverable only in comparatively late evidences.
.. . It is very probable . . . that the colonists of Britain arranged them·
selves in hundreda of warriors3 it is not probable that the country was
carved into equal mensu. The only conclusion that seems reasonable is
that, under the name of geographical hundreda, we have the variously sized
pagi or districts in which the hundred warriors settled, the boundaries of
these being determined by other causes, as the courses of the rivers, the
ranges ol hills, the distribution of estates to the chieftains‚ and the remnants
of British independence The fact that the hundred appears first in the laws
of Edgar, and with an adaptation to a particular police institution, the
pursuit and capture of thieves, might seem to mark the definite application
of the name to the territoria] area, which may have been called wapentalre,
ward, or even shire at an earlier period. But the particular measure then
adopted seems ratberto imply the previous existence of the district name.
. . . The tradition preserved by William of Malmesbury that Alfred devised
the arrangement into hundreda and tithings, although, as it stands, irrecon-
cileable with facts, may embody a portion of a historical trutla Alfred may
have adopted the hundred as a basis for rating, as Edgar did for police, or
may have anticipated the measures of his descendants. . . . The wapentake
in all respects of administration auswers directly to the hundred, and no
attempt can be made to account for its origin on the principle of symmetrical
division. Nor is it easy to determine the origin of the variety of systems
into which the hundred jurisdiction is worked. . . . Yorkshire and Lincoln-
shire were divided into Trithings or nidinga, subdivided generally into
wapentalres ; but in Domesday the East Riding is divided into hundredo
only, aud in Linoolnshire, Northamptonshire, and Rutland, the wapentake
and the hundred are arranged side by side. Of the Yorkshirc subdivisione
two, Borghesbire and Graveshire, the latter of which is never called a
wapentake, retain the name of shire; and it is given in later documenta tc
Richmondshire, Riponshire, Hellamshire‚ Islandshire, Norbamsbire, and
probably other similar districts. Nottingbanrshire‚ Derbyshire, and Leices·
tershire are, in Domesday, arranged in wapentakes but iu one plaoe the term
‘hundred’ is used in reference to a division of the last-named county.’' We
observe that throughout Professor Stubbs writes in the sense hundred cr
wapentalre, or that the one, “in all respecta of administration, answers
directly to’' the other. In our present instance we have the service, exac-
tion, or due denoted bytho use of the word “wapentac” coincident and
collateral with that denoted hythe word hundredz; these are as distinct
from each other aa each is distinct from the county dues (comitatus) mentioned
immediately before them, and the circumstance is wortby of note.
