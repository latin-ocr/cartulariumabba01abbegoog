inaccurate nor misleading. Assuming Freeman's statement as
15 1115 amount 51 the last assessment of Danegeld during tha
Conqueror's reign 1-namely, 65. per hide-to be valid, and
11151151 such practioel purposes as the present calculation the
carucata contained about three hides, and that, in Freeman’s
worda, “ along with the Danegeld, a tax which was strictly a
tax upon the land, came the aida 511115 towns, an impost
which has been held 15 be in effect the Danegeld levied on
those parts 51 the kingdom to which the reckoning by hides
could not apply;'' then we have this remarkable result :-
Lolthouse, with 115 51 5511155155 containing about 153 hides,
each rated 51 65, was geldable at 1145, 185. the balance
making up the 148 11511156 in Domesday, being, it 15 presumed,
due on the town. Stokesley, with 401 carucatas, or about 121
hides, at 655 hide, ought to have been rateable 51 136, 65,
11111 was actually geldable at only 124 (however that 1551 1515
be accounted 151) z Hutton Rudby, with its 26 carucatas, 51 1· 8
1116551155 rateable 51 121, 185, leaving 5 balance 51 12, 25. 15
make up the Domesday value 51 124; while Whitby, with
43} 5511155155, equivalent 15 about 130 hides, at 65. 5 hide,
would return 139, leaving 5 balance 51 some ar 3 to be made
good by the aid 115111 the town and port; aconolusion which
sorely militates against the idea that the town, as weil 55 the
monastery, lay in ruin and desolation all through the two
hundred years alleged.

Before finally leaving the question thus discussed, there 15
5115 other remark I would fain make, somewhat retrospeotive in
its nature, and founded on astatement which is met with in
the “ Memorial 51 Β5115155115115,” touching the last condition 51
min which had undoubtedly befallen the monastery. Speak-
ing 51 the grant 51 the “ hallowed place '' to Reinfrid, the first
Prior, by William de Ρ5151, the writer mentions a fact which is
151 without significares as to what the foundation had become
before that great ruin had 1511511 upon it. “ There were at that

time,'' he says, “in the said vill, 55 ancient countrymen have =

delivered to ua, about forty cells cr oratorias, only the walls 51
which, however, together with the disused and shelterless
altars, remained.'’ Now, 115111 this we may gather something
