INTRODUOTORY OHAPTERS. lxxv

Hackenas.¹ This measure of consentaneity between the two
authorities, independently of the intrinsic probability that such
raids of robbers by land and robbers by sea would surely be
made, renders it as nearly certain as possible that, subsequently
to some such act ol robbery and devastation, the community
did take a temporary refuge, and of course at Hackness, the

seat of the ancient cell of the Whitby Monast'ery. And it
surely is not impossible, perhaps not ,even altogether unlikely‚
that, in their absence, such a sub-grant as that specified in the
Domesday notice, and notin the least necessarily interfering
with the bonafide and still valid original grant ol the ancient
abbey church, with its site and appurtenances,2 may have
actually been conceded, on such considerations as those stated
a little above, or on others together with thern, to the man who
was, it may be, already Abbotdesignate of York.
Up to the time ot the Conqueror’s deaceae, and taking ou‘i
information from the Memorial‚ from Earl Hugh’s charter, from

¹1w0u1ddraw attention here to the discrepancy between the statement in
tha narrative last referred to and the real facta of the case touching the
charoli ol the cell or “monasterium ’' of Hactenus-“Qua de cauea‚'’ says this
writer. “ Sarlo Prior et Monachi de Whitby ostenderunt Willelmo dc Percy
calamitatem suam at miseriam, et petierunt illum ut daret eis locum manendi
apud Haclrenm Dedit eia eeclesiam Sanctae Mariae de Hackenaa ut ibi
mnatruerent monasterium, quia in eadem villa S. Hilda Abbatiasa monas·
terium construxerat.” Not only, however, does the memorialiat expresaly
atate that Prior Rcinin'd's body waa buried at Hackenas—“in cimiterio S.
Petri iu medio parietis contra altare,’' and specify “ ecclesiam S. Petri ubi
monachi nostri Deo servierunt, obierunt et sepulti sunt‚'’ but the Conqueror’a
confirmation accures to the said morke ecclesiam S. Petri de Hakeneesa
cotemporaneoualy with the gift of the two carucatas oi Royal demesne
there, and the two additional carucatas at Northiald.

’That the site and precinctu of the ancient abbey once given to Reinfrid
were ever alienated from any of his successore, or that such an attempt was
made, it seems impossible to believe. Tha original grant may have in-
cluded, and most likely did include, besides the said site, precincta and
buildings or ruins thereupon, a certain amount of territory-adjacens is not
an infrequent word in deeds of gift used in description oi the land which
appartained to the church, or what not, given-and thia adjoining territory
would be distinctly church land, and would remain such as effectually as
the sita, precincts, etc. The grant to the Abbot ol Yorlr might still be
easily inmished forth out oi landa in Sourcby which were not church

landa
