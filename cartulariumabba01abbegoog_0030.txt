mains to tell where the meare-mdc of its district used to be held
—and tha “Wapentake'’ and “Thing-stead” remainto tell us
oi the pervading change which had come over the institutions
of the fair country which had been re·named Oliffliind by its
new lords3 and, in telling us of this, the Whitby Thingwala
tells us, incidentally it is true, but also most emphatically,
that Whitby, under the occupatiori and rule of the Danas, was,
out of all Olevaland, by far the most important and the most
frequented town, as being tha seat of all their principal civil
and religious procedures and observances.

But this fact, as it seems to me, is not very consistent, any
more than that of the tolerably well-established characteres
the hardy N ertbmen as vigorous farmars, persevering tradere,
adventurous navigators, with the notion that the town of
Whitby, as wall as its monastery, lay desolate andin ruins
until the restoration of tha Abbey in N erman times.

But the matter is placed quite beyond disputa—and my
marvel is that such a painstaking and caraiul man as Young

corresponding entries, connected with the more important
Oleveland localities, we find the following :-in the manor of
Locthusum (now Lofthouse), with 4 carucatas, and soka in
various other townships and parishes, amounting in all to ’
nearly 47 carucatas besides, the geldable velue was sta. At
Stocheslaye (Stokesley), with a monor of 6 carucatas, and soka
of 34} carucatas more in seven other places, the valna is set at
fit. At Hoton (Hutton Rudby), with 6 carucatas, and soka
of 20 carucates marein other placas, the sum set down is 524.
On comparison then, Whitby, with a total of 43} carucatas, is
