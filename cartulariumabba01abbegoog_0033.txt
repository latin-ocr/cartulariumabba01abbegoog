xxvi INTRODUOTORY CHAPTERS.

as to what the early monastery had come to be, before destruc·
tion came upon it, both in magnitude and extent3 and also as
to the massiva nature of the buildings which had, sooner or
later, replaced the hasty and rude structuras glanced at some
pages above as more than possible during the earlier partos

the existence of the “Holy House.'' Walls and altars, which
still retained their form and consistency after two centurias
of exposure and neglect, over and above the violence of the
original havoc, must have been strong and well-built as well
as massrve.

It would be but to little pmpose to speculata on the religione Δ
and ecclesiastical condition of Whitby and its district during
the period of Danish occupancy. Dr. Young remarks, that‘ml
we know with certainty on the subjectis that there were six· ·
taen churches in our district when Domesday was compiled Α
Several of them were without pastors. . . . It is observabla
too, that most of them were near the extreme limite of the
district; that there was no chureh at Streoneahalh, nor in the
vale of usk: tha nearest churches were those of Seatonand

these are open to grave doubt. The fatal word “ waste'' is not
applied in the Domesday entry touching “Hagenesse et Sudfelt
et Evrelai,” aa it is in the case of Whitby ; and it is almoa
impossible to suppose that, for two hundred years, such a district
as Whitby clearly was, lay churchless, and therefore practically,
in those days, religionless. Nay, if one ventured to speculato
at all, it would be in the direction that not only did a chureh
or churches, risc in Whitby itself, but that more than one or two
among the “ oratorias '' on Prestebi heights found holy occu·

‘ pants, and, most likely, continuously. If the namePrestebihad

a meaning at all,if it was not simplya case ol lacus om
lacendo, the fact it reveals is that one priest or more settled on
or near the site of the ruined monastery subsequently to tha
Danish occupation3 and, certainly, there can be no doubt aaa ³
the country had become Christianised long before the date ol the
Norman Conquest. .
But whatever the ecclesiastical condition of Whitby and ia
dependenoies during the Danish supremacy, a time soon came
