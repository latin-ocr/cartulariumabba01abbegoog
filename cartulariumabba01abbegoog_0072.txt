said landa is specified, and hy which it is formally conveyed, is
a charter of the Conqueror's and not of his son William’s; and
second, that the charter of the latter—proved his beyond ques-
tion by the specified grant of the church of All Saints in
Fishergate——deals with the aforesaid lande as already in the
possession of the monastery in virtue of a former grant by
another than himself—“ de terris quas de dominio meo possid-
ent‚'' being the terme employed. The fact that remains, then,
is that the lands in Haclmess and Nordfeld, alleged by the
unknown writer whose statements are under examination to
have been granted by Ruina, at Prior Serlo's petition‚ to him and
his monastery, were not so granted by him, but had been given
by his father in the interval between the date of the Domes-
day inquiry and that of his death. And this being so, the
doubts as to the acouracy and trustworthiness of this unknown
writer, suggested by his statements made in reference to
Radulfus de Everley, are still further provolred and greatly
⁴ augmented‚ by this detection of a direct historical misstate-
ment—possibly unintentional as it may really have been.

But there is yet another historical misstatement involved in
the same narrative which still further diminishes any confi-
dence we might even wish to feel in the writer in question.
Haclmess was not only not “ in feudo Domini Regis‚'' but was
in reality in that of William de Percy, at a distance from whom
and whose territory the petitioner for these lands is represented
as wishing to remove himself and his monastery3 a circum·
stance which inevitably discredits either the writer’s honesty
or his qualification as a trustworthy historiari.

We have still the statements touching the desire manifested
by William de Percy to take from his brother all the lands and
vills he had hitherto bestowed on the monastery to inquire
into; but before doing sc, there are other matters which it will
be better to pass in review and consider-matters which depend
onan entry in Domesday of such a nature as to introduce
new perplexities. Itis thisz—speaking of Whitby with its
sokes, these latter amounting in all to twenty-eight carucatas
liable to Danegeld, the compiler says—“ Haec habet Engo, et
Willelmus de Percide eo. Paene omnia wasta. Tantummodo
in Prestebi et Sourebi quae dc Willelmo habct Abbas Ebora·
