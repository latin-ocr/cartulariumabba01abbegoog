gggiggffi which could not have been granted earlier than about 1135 ; he

ogtoturow rs also witness 10 two charters by Alan Buscel (00001 Reginald

...000 probablya grandson 01 theman whose “ armiger '' Radulf de

Armiger a much younger man than the date Ι01 110 assumed

grant to him would require—to belong, in 1001, 10 110 genera·

tion next in succession-the language 01 110 charters is hardly
consistent with any such grant. For we find William de Percy,

early in the reign 01 Rufus, conveying and confirming, among

many other large grants, “ N ordield, Sudfeld, Everlaye et Brok·

esaye et Tornelaye ;'' his wife Emma de Port, 110 sons Alan,

Walter and Richard, his kinsman Emald de Peroy (lord 01 110

Kildale and Ormesby maneria), the Archbishop Thomas, Fulco

Depiier, Gilebert fitzAdelard (a witness 10 Earl Hugh’s grant

already noticed) being among the witnesses. Also, towards the

close 01 Rufus’ reign, or at the very beginning 01 Ηο0οΥ0, and

certainly between 1097 and 1101,1 we havea oharter from Alan

de Percy confirming the vilis 01 Filing, Haukesgarth and Nor·
manby, which Abbot William had bought 01 Tanchardus Flan-
drensis, 10 which Radulphus de Everley is himself a 011000ος
001 early in the reign 01 Hemy 1., other two oharters by Alan
de Peroy,in the second 01 which heformally confirms to Whitby
Hackness and the two churches 01 St. Maryand St. Peter there,

¹ I think this is to be inferred from the 10000 employed when Hugh, nul
of Chester, 10 named among the other persone to be prayed for :—·‘ Omna
has vero ecelesias, etc, dedi Deo 010, pro 0. animarum Regum Angliae, 010,01
pro Hugone cestrensi Comite, et pro salute anima meae, etc.'’ Compare ue
corresponding passage in the next preceding oharter-that 01 110 Founder:
-—“ pro anima d'ni mei Willelmi Regis Anglorum 01 d’nae meae Matildit
Reginae 3 necnon pro d'no mec Rege Willelmo eorum filio . . . 01 pro 110
meo Hugone cestrensi comite et pro animabus omnium parentum meum, et
pro memet ipso, et Emma de Port uxore mea, at Alano de Porci filio nostro, 1
010.,” as to which one cannot but observe that there 10 0 marked differeneein
speaking 01 11000 already dead and those who are 01111 living, 101 ior when,
equally with those who are dead, the prayers 01 110 Church are desired ms
0001010 true in 1110 first oharter by Alan de Perci. Hugh, Earl 01 0100100, is
yet living: the prayere desired are desired for him, not ior his 10000101
0001. Αο1 hence, as he died in 1101, 110 1010 01 110 oharter may be very
saiely and very approximately inferred.
