1 This is rather an extraordinary document, inasmuch aa the statements
it makes are iu some instances entirely incompatible with known facts, and
even, as will be noticed below, with the direct and most distinct statements
conveyed or involved in not a few 81 the Charters contained in the preced-
ing parts 81 the book itself. This is unfortunate, as beringa direct tendency
and force towards rendering its statements, when more in consistency with
truth and evidence, 81 1888 authority. Were it otherwise the statements
involved in the sentences to which this note is appended would be 81 great
value as well as importance. As noted in the Introductory Chapters, there
18 no evidence 81 any sort to indicate the manner in which the Whitby
landa passed from Hugh 81 chester to William de Percy as tenant 18 capite.
All that we know 18 that they did 88 pass, and it is at least not improbable
that they passed in the manner stated in the present sentences. Again,
there 18 every ground, in the way 81 reasoning and induction, for arriving at
the unhesitating conclusion that the donation 81 Whitby Strand to the Abbey
was made in the conqueror's time, and in all particulare as here stated.
These statements then would be 81 great interest, and greater value, as at
once removing the doubts implied or expressed by Charlton and Yonng, and

connecting the misunderstandings 81 those authore, were it not for the blem· ι

the Bench on the accession 81 Edw. 1., and continued tc act for many years
