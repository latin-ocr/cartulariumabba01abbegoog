and William de Percy are witnesses, the King explicitly con·
cedes and confirms to the obnrch of Wbitby and Prior Scrlo,
over and abore like libertina with those of the churches of
Ripon, Beverley and Se Peter oi York, the ohurch oi St. Peter
at Hacknesa as well as two carucatas of land in the same vill,
four more at Nordfeld, and two in Briniston, together with
“saca and soona,” and immunity from Danegeld as to the said

lands; the langurme as regards the church being unmistakably
that- oi a confirmation, and not of an original grant.¹

It is almost idle to say that it seems by no means improbable
-for t-he inference is almost forced upon us—that Haokness,
or, to speak more speoifically, the church oi St Peter there,
with its patrimony or appurtenances-oi whatever extent the
latter may have been-was looked upon from the first as among
the matters os property or possession appertaining tc St Peter’s
of Whitby. Hugh os Ohester confimo, or at least concedes, to
'Prior Reinfrid and his convent, the chnrch oi St Peter ot
Whitby and all thmgs which portam to it ;2 and it is certainly
easier to connect the granta by the Conqueror and William de
Percy³ of land at Hackness with a monastic church already

¹ “Concedo etiam et confirmo eidem Ecclesia de Whiteby (te Ecclesia S.
Petri de Prestoby etde Whiteby et Ssrloni Priori et monachis ibidem Deo
servientibus) ecclesiam S. Petri de Hachanessa, et in eadem villa ii amata
terra, et in Nordield iv, et in Briniston ii, cam saca et socna, et sine omni
geldo.’'

² 'l'he wording is, “ et omnia quse ad eam pertinent,” in place of the
customary “cnm omnibus sais appendiciis,” and so tar the verb is “con-
cessi ;'' and then to the said monks and their cbnrch ho further makes the
gift or grant oi (⁴⁸dedi’h the obnrch of Midlesbnrg (written Fleinesbnrg) and
its tithea The words “omnia qua ad eam pertinent '’ are of wide extent,
and may well include not only (as they, 1 think, certainly did) tha Port and
its accompanying rights, etc, but what had been one ot the most important
portions of the property cf the old foundation-namsly, Hackness and ia
monkr'sh obnrch, which one, at least, oi the three named in Domesday as still
in being then, clearly was.

³ Ι think it is important to note that from the langnage and tenor oi tha
charters themselves, quite independently oi any other source oi information
or deductiori, there were at least, so to spoak, two periods oi benefaction on
the part of William de Perci-the first, which is marked by tho, in part,
confirmatory charter oi the Earl oi Chestor3 the second, which is designated
by his own chartea to which his wile, his hsir Alan, and his other sons
Walter and William, as well as Archbishop Thomas oi Ycrk, are desmibed
