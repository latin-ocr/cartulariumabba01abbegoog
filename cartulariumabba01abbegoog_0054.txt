Convent of Whitby was able, in virtue oi the grant of Earl
Hugh of Chester, to allege a claim to the whole tithes and all
parochial customs (save only certain burial sees) belonging to
the Ghureh of Midelesburg and arising out of the aforesaid
lands in the manerium of Aclum, and Bobert de Brus, the
then owner of all, or nearly all, the Earl of Chester's late interest
in the said manerium, and besides that the munificent founder
and special patron oi one of the contending Houses, is himself
a party tc “ the part '' of the other house1-under such eircum-
stances, I think it must be abundantly clear not only that the
original grant was sufficiently notorious and important, but
even so much so that any modification of its tenor required the
formal consent and oo·operation oi the original grantor's suc-
cessor and representative. And thus, taking into consideration
alac, that not only did not the Ohureh of Flamborough, with
its tithes, ever belong to Whitby-in fact it belonged to Brid-
lingt0n2 in the next century——but that no reference, however
slight, is ever again made to the subject in the reeords of the
Abbey, I arrive at the conclusion that, in the charter now
under notice, although the name Fleinesburg is written, it was
so written, bya slip of the copyist's pen, instead oi Midelesburg,
and that the ehurch of the latter place, with all its tithes and
parochia] customs (save only the exception noted above), and
other appurtenanoes (the endowment carucate oi land, of course,
included), was granted³ by Hugh Earl cf Chester, together with
the confirmation of the Ohurch oi St. Peter at Whitby, to Prior

1 “ Hunc finem et concordiam inter praedictos Canonioos et Monachos con-
cessit et confirmavit ex sua parte Capitulum canonicorum de Giseburna, et
Capitulum Monachcrum de Wytebi et Robertus de Brus exparte sua.’'

² At p. 226 (Mora. libor.) Burton notes the gift oi the Ohurch oi Flame-
bnrgh tc Bridlington by William FitzNigel ; and at page 72, in anote to the
statement in the text that Hugh Earl of Chester gave the said ehurch and its
tithes tc Whitby, he adds-“ But I can't suppose it could mean Flamburg,
because that ehurch was given to the Priory of Bridlington.’'

³ Οἱ course it may be alleged that the charter oi Robert de Brus (No. lll)
involves the original gilt and conveyance of the (lhurch of Midelesburgh,
with all its appurtenanoes. It is probably sufficient to remark in reply that,
admitting the indisputable grant oi that ehurch and its tithes by the Earl of
Chester, the charter in question is but a deed cf renewed gift and confirma-
tion made requisita hythe grantor’s accession to what was part and parcel
oi the llari oi Chester’a fec, as well as a conveyance of the new donaticn of
