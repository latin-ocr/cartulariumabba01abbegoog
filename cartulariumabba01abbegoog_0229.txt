¹ M. Hornegard Both Young aud Chariton deul vith the absurd fable-
foritsan hardly be called legend-which professes to explain the origin cf
the service called Hcrngarth, the former at pp. eoa-³14, the latter, pp.
lau-lea, and both of them exposa the historicsl misstatements aud centa·
dictione involved in it; but both of them are equally at a loss to assign a
reasonable explanation of either origin or object in its place. Youug says-
“What was the use of this garth itisnot sc easy to naumain Perhaps it
was the Abbot’s ocal-yard, where the coals ior the monastery were delivered
and laid up; or it might be, as Chariton conjectures, a kind of stom-yud,
where goods vvere lauded and deposited.'' ¹(tharlton's guesses, cr some cf
them, will he found at p. 128. There is no need tc deal with auy oi theru
in detail; they are all equally unsatisfactory, not to say absurd. There ean
he nc question as to the antiquity oi the service, inasmuch as iu No. 265
Abbot Beuedict, in renevviug to Williaur de Percy, son of Richard de Percy
de Dunsley‚ the plenary grant oi that territory as previously enjoyed by his
father, specifice a yearly payment oi two marks inlisu of all other services,
“excepto Hornegarth quantum ad terram suam pertinet.” 'l'his carries
bach the existence cf the service in question tc the times of the Euander,
the aforesaid Richard de Percy being his son. There can he equally little in
the way of question as to the comprehensive nature of the obligatior to
render the said service ; it seems clearly to have beeu compulsory on all the
“homines'' or sub-feudatories, of the Abbey. Oharltou notes this, p. 1³0,
specifying‚ and quite correetly, those who held Dunsley‚ Sueten, Everley‚
Ugglehardby, Sleights, Fylingdalea and inierring the same of all the
homagers in the Liberty. The only real questions are as to the nature aud
extent of the service itself. That it was the making up ci a fenea cf some
sort may be assumed as a matter of course That the fence was a very real
one, and of considerable extent, is sufficiently indicated by the fact that
enough wood was required for making the part allotted to only one of the
tenente or homagers‚ to make it worth the while of theman employed, to dc
a bit of peculation with the surptus, and, more inferentially‚ that it required

the labcur oi a number of men to complete such part. See No. 380, fourth ,

article, wherein both of these positione are amply supported, Sueten· being
the place, and Alexander de Percy the person, in question ς and wherein,
messover, the question of the persoaol service of the varicus “homines”
