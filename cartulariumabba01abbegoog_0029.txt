In this connection I wish to draw especial attention to the
great 1111 involved in the name which stands fourth in the
list 11 Whitby ploce-names given 1 few lines above-I mean
Thingwala.

It seems to heve been reserved 111 me even to notice, and
much more to direct attention 11, thie very nctcworthy and
significant neme² For there 111 be no more question 11 what
it was, and meant, than in· the cese 11 the Oheshire Thingwall,
the Shetland Tingwall 11 Dingwall, or even the Icelendie
Thingvalla itself. As Wcrsaae says 11 the former, 1111 Whitby
Thingwele “ affords every remarkable memorial 11 the Gourt
-or Thing-which the Northmen settlers were accustomed 11
hold in close connection with their sacred offerings to their
goda.’' Its site, however, is now uncertain. All we kncwis
that it existed, and that down to the beginning 11 the thirteenth
century certainly, ond probably very much later, it was identi-
fiable.

But to us the significanee 11 the name end 11 the 1111 is not
the least lessened by the difficulty, 11 worse, 11 identilying the
site. The Old English “merke'' “tythings,’' “hundreda’'
’ “ trithborhs,” had all been swept away-seve only the name 11 ,

and not 111 from Gnipe (now Hawsker), was not less than 13801 year.
