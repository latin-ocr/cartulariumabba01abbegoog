Osberto Arundel. Rogero de Snetun.¹⁰ Ivone de Ugelhardcby,

Hauckesgard are both 00 named, or rather named under such circumstances
that there can be no reasonable doubt as to the fact 01 their being Asketil’s
sons ; and probably William, as named aiter his grandfather, would be the
eldest son and heir. From William de Haulsesgarth springs 0 son Thomas,
who again has issue, by his wife Juliana, 01 0 son Thomas. (See No. 163.)
Roger‚ Asohetin's second son, has issue, Reginald de Haulsesgartm Adam, and

William de Haukesgard Reginald’s wife is named Euiemia (No. 164),
while William’s wife is cecilia, their son being Adam (ib). These two deeds
bring us down to c. 1230-1240. In No. 475, aswitnessesto agrantby Reginsld
de Haukesgart, Adam de Haukesgart and his son Thomas appear. This
is no doubt Reginald, son of Rogcr, 00 above. In Nos 476, 478, 479, deeds
dating in the early part 01 11ιο fourteenth century, we have 0 Nicholssde
Haukesgarth sonci Thomas, who speaks of ‘¹ Manerium meum de naurs
garth,'' which makes it nearly certain that Thomas, son of Thomas, and l
grandson ol william, the assumed eldest son of Arretino, is the Thomas
named as the father 01 the said Nicholas. In No. 480, also dated, like ore
01 those last cited, in 1308, we have Adam, son of Nioholas de Haulresgerth,
quitclaiming to Whithy all his right and claim in and 10 11ιο usmis ‚
manor. At this time Thomas de Haukesgarth, who became Abbot in or
immediately aiter 1322, must have been a monk 01 Whitby; and it isnot
unreasonable to assume that he was brother of Nicholas and uncle oi som
last named. That he was closely connected there can be no doubt.
