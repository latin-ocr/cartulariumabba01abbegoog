by Ernald de Persi, and the estimation in which hs was held, is worthy of
note, as also is the fact that though undoubtedly a connection of tha great
Percies who founded and endowed Whitby-his name frequently appears as
that of a witness to important docrnnents executed by them—yet he is, un-
like Pichot ds Peroy and his descendants, not a subfeudatory of theirs, but
ofthe Brus family. There is little or no doubt that, attho date of the
foundation of Gysburne‚ and probably for several years anterior to it, he
was, and had been, lord of the Kildale fec, and no doubt at all that hs was
the founder of the Kildale family. The charters, executed by himself, his
sons, and other lineal descendants, copies of which are contained in the
Gysburne chartulary, prove this to demonstration and effectually dispose
of the frequently repeated, but utterly groundless, so-called genealogical
statemeuts which attempt to darive the Kildale Percies from the Whitby
stock, through Walter, son of Alan, and grandson of William hote les Ger-
nuns, the founder of Whitby.
