Serloni fratri suo, Priori de Whitby et (16 Hackenas, et
monachis ibidem Deo serv, suam omnimodo firmam paoem
teneret, nec eis ullam molestiam inferret ;'' and further, that in
the desire to put some sensible distance between himself and
his brother and 1ο abide within the king’s 166, Serlo begged the
king to give 1111106110ηά his monks, in perpetual alms, six
carucates 01 larid in his demesne, namely, two at Hackenas and
four in N orthfeld, with all their appurtenances.

Now there is, I think, in this story, as in that by the alleged
Stephen, certainly a mixture of fact and of fiction; only, that
the latter proceeds rather from misoonoeption, or imperfect
information perhaps, than fro'm that vein 01 misrepresentation
which, it seems 10 me, is the leading feature in the Stephen
narrative-

1. In the first place,I doubt, and on divers grounds, the
accuraoy of the statement concerning Ralph de Everley.

2. In the second, I doubt the accuracy of the statements-
there is one preceding the extract I have given—touching the
royal donations at and near Hackness.

3. And 111 the third, Ι doubt the statement—as it stands and
is meant to imply—-about the wish of William (16 Percy to take
all the lands and wills he had given to Whitby from his brother
Serlo.

That there was a dispute between the brothers I think pos·
sible, and more than merely possible ; that William de Percy
adopted the alleged line of conduct in the Priorate-Stephen's
according 10 the pseudo-Stephen, Reinfrid's according 101116
Memorialist-preceding Serlo's, and again in Serlo’s, I do not
think probable. That we may be led on to think the differencc
arose during the latter period, and 11101 the pseudo-stophen
wrongly puts it in the earlier period, I dcem to be consistent
with the facts which we are certain of, and which 016 such, when
taken together, as to lead on to probable presumption 0010 the
nature of the dispute or diffcrence, as well as 10 the facts of its
being: and to 0 full consideration 01 these matters wc shall
come in duc time. For the present, other matters must claim
our attention.

1. First, asto Radulphus de Everley. His name occurs as
witness to 0 charter by Alan, son 01 Radulphus de Ferlington,
