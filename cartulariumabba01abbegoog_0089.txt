011 Abbaoy, the language bare employed appears to be signifi·
cant ;1 and the circumstance that the grant is made to Prior
Serlo, and 1110 11100110 sarving God 01 Whitby, makes it in sofar
more probable that 1110 measures which wera already taken, or
were to be taken in the close sequel, for raising the House toa
higher dignity, were designed and carried out with the existing
Prior’s full concurrenoe. Probably, too, the appointment 01 the
first Abbot would follow at no very remote date after the exe·
oution 01 the 01101101 and 1110 formal completion 01110 purpose.

At least 11110 much is certain, that William de Percy had
been created Abbot antecedently to the year 1100,2 and among
the charters printed in the text isone by Henry 1. (No.
190) addressed to Archbishop Thomas of York, Osbert the
Sheriff, Nigal de Albini, and Aschetil de Bulmer‚ which
contains the following remarkable 01000ος-“ Sciatis quod
Willelmus‚ Abbas de Wyteby, et monachi illius loci deder-
1101Ι 0110111 111 10100110 0010 001000 cervos et cervas 01 porcos,
01 ago illos forestavi michi 01 haeredibus 01010.” Τ1101 this gift
or concession had been made in 1110 guise 01 aquid pro qual
suppose must be regarded as an absolute certainty. Itis of
course possible that it was 111 return for it that the King granta
the full confirmation which the remaining part 01 the 01101101
conveys. But with the great accumulation 01 benefactions
which had recently flowed in upon 1110 Whitby House from the
various branches of the Perci family and their connectione
(not to mention other benefactors), it is hardly reasonable to
suppose that there could have been any difficulty about the
customary money aoknowledgment for such a concession on
the part 01 the reigning Kiug3 and besides, 1110 disproportion
between tha concession made by the Abbot and monks to the

King, and the King's 0000000100 10 them, is far too great to

¹ Apart 11001 the fact that 1110 Priory was converted into 00 Abbey,l
think no great amount 01 011000 could ba laid 00 the language in question;

101, 10 0110 but one instance, in tha 01101101 01 Rufus the grant of the All
Saints Ohurch at York 10 made in 111000 terma :-1=“ Dedi etiam eidem

perp, eccl. O'ium S’torum de Fischergata de Ebor. ad abbatiam constituan-
dam,'’ etc, where 1110 meaning 01 “ abbatiam '² can scarcely be anything but
“ cell.'’ The only other meaning possible would be that 1110 grant was a
grant in aid of 1110 proposed 0100110001 00 Abbey at Whitby 10 repleas 1110
