arry with it. And this 10 the more unfortunate because
entirely evident that a connection 01 some kind did exist
ad existed between the early monastic settlers at Whitby,

tually became the Abbot and Conventus St. Marys at

'br it is not only this perplexing entry in Domesday that

ates such a connection3 there is the distinct statement by
