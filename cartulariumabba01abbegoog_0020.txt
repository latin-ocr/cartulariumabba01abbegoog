OHAPTER Ι.

Tim first authentic mention of the place now called Whitby
appears to have been made by Bede in his Histoop of tho
Choreb, and from his mention ol the place ita name in 656
was Streanaeshalch:—at least, I think it is a fair inference
from his words that that name had been already imposed
before the foundation of the AngloSaxon monastery took place.

That this name had-like all other place-names—its own
proper signification, is a matter of absolute certainty: what
that signification may have been is, however, almost equally
uncertain. Certainly, as I have said elsewhere,1 Bede's inter·
pretation-“Streanaeshalc, quod interpretatur Sinus Fari ”-
ought to be satisfactory3 but it is not, for the name consisto
of two elements, neither of which, as it would seem, can
possibly mean sinus, orbay. Touobing this, Young, the Whitby
historiari, remarks-“I am fully persuaded that this interpreta-
tion must be erroneous; but as it is not likely that Bede
himself could mistake its meaning, Ι am disposed to think

that the passage is an interpolation by some ignorant tran· ’

seriber, or rather that ‘Sinus fari’ is not the true reading ;'' and
he adds that, though Henry of Huntingdon, Matthew of
Westminster‚ and other ancient authors, have quoted Bede’s
explanation of Heortea or Heoruteu, none of them, save Roger
Hoveden alone, have quoted the translation (of streanaeshalch,
namely) ‘Sinus fari! ''
