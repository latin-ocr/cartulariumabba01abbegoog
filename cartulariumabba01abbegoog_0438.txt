at once scen to be more than justifiable. The first part of the boundery in
question, or lrom Howe Bridge along the Rye to the influx of the Seven, and
thence to the source of the stream so named, is easily traced on any mode·
rately good map. From the said source to Ralph Oross is but a short step, ol
under a mile. Crux Rednlphi is specially named in several ol the Gyseburne
deeds as ono among the bounder-marks serviceable in marking off certain
grants hythe house ol de Brus to the Priory, and it is still standing, and
the existing or modern boundary takes a fairly direct course to the next
mereor bounder. In the document before us this ie designated as West
Shoner Howes‚ aname not recognisable now, but beyond question identifi-
able es the howes near White Cross in the Ordnance Survey. Lowsohowes
is the modern Ioose Howe ; Willclmi howesis represented by William Hill in
the boundary between Danby and Rosednle as it existed up to a quite recent
private arrangement between the lords ol these adjoining mauors, and in whet
inpracticully the existing boundary ol Olevcland. Est ShouerhowesisShunner

and from thence the Wheeldele gill and beck are speedily reached. The
course ol the Mirh Esk lrom this point insufficiently obvious as a boundary3
but a considerable difficulty presente itseli in connection with thelclanse,

into the Mirk Esk, not into the usk itself, and the united streame llow
into the Esk ; neither is there any “ furca de Lythebecke.” There is no way
in which the delineatiou of this part of the bonndary can he made intelligi
ble. 'l'he only supposition is that the scribe blundered his copy nnmercilully,
and that he meant to say the boundary which, at the point where Lithebeck
falls into the Mirk Esk-only a few dozen yards from Grosmont Charch-
becomes eleo the boundary of Whitby Liberty, aiter prooeeding to the mk
returns again to the point at which Lithebeck falls into Mirk m, and,
making a forlr there with its former course, proceeds thence to Calverleygate,
aud so, forward. Now here, reference may be made to th'e bonndaryar
given iu the Peroy Charieis, and divers royal and other confirmations (set
Nos. 27-the second so nnmbered-l86, 190, etc), only promising that the =
course ol bonndary described in the prcsent document is in the directior
opposite to that taken iu the documents just cited. In the lotterwe go
from Lithehech beck to Sylehow ; in the present case from Lithebechto
Oalvcrleygate, thence along below the brae to the Miokle Stone (pombly
connected with what are now called the Bride Stonee), and thence in lile
manner-that is, along below the brae-to Sillhowes. In the wtity
bouudary, again, it is back from Sylehow to Scogrnineshcweu in the (lom-
mcnt before us, the course is from Sillhowes to Forsterhowes-now Ful!
Howes-aud thence to Seotgrauehowes (see Note 23 to No. 27—aeaoudu
