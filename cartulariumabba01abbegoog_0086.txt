its nature and its probable acerbity-which would certainly
not be diminished by the recollection that he and his Monas-
tery had become so far important and influential—must all be
admitted ; in the 101101, when we take into consideration the
strangely loose and inaccurate way-not to say the reckless
and mythical, or the intentionally incorrect and mendacious
wey—in which the writers 01 such narratives as that 01 the
alleged Stephon and 011110 Dodsworth memoranda, and even
some 01 the later monastic scribes,1 put their sc-oalled history ,
together, there is no difficulty in accounting for such tales as
those which convey 10 us all the information we possess aa 10
variance between Serlo and his brother, and particularly as 10
the desire and attempt 01 the latter 10 take back all his former
gitta 10 the Monastery. On the whole, Ι entertain little doubt
that William de Perci did, 101 0010 reason or other, press, 01
perhaps 10100, upon his brother the resignation 01 the headship
01 the Whitby Monastery ; and that the pressure so applied
was applied at the time he had mede, and been enabled to

(p. 312), which occurs 01 1. 129 01 the Strickland Ma, and which would
be very valuable in elucidating our present part 01 the early history 01 the
Abbey 11 we could depend on its statements. But when we find 01011 alle·
geticus deliberately put fcrward, and in the very 100111 01 charter alter
charter and one Royal confirmation 01101 another, that Alae, 001 01 William
de Percy the founder, died without heir3 that the Percy inhesitance 01 his
death descended to 1110 brother Richard—Richard de Percy de Dunsley, 01
course-and 101110οο1 William 01101 him ; and that the said Richard “nichil
dedit 100 confirmavit,'' it is impossible 10 attach any real credit to what
may be said in other parts 01 the same document as 10 1011010 about which
certain historica] knowledge must have been, at all events, much more diffi-
011110 arrivs 01, and indeed 101 10 be arrived 01 01 011 except by diligent
study and comparison 01 the very documenta this scribe either never knew
01 00 existing, or never consulted 11 he was acquainted with them, or
deliberately put cn one side as 101 worth the trouble 01 examinatiore Stin,
notwithstanding this, 101 my own part I fully believe that 11110 writer 10
mainly correct 111110 statements he makes 00101110 extent and the bound-
aries 01 the lands which he says were given by William ‹le Percy to God,
St. Peter aud St. Hilda 01 Whitby, and to 1110 brother Serlo; and I have
sought 00 101 00 Ι could to make the viewin question good by independent
reasoning. But, on the grounds above stated, Ι have not 011000110 appeal
101 support 10 the direct statements in point which this writer makes, when
his trustworthiuess 10 assailed by such reokless misstatements 00 those

exywsed in this note.
