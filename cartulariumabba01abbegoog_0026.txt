INTRODUGTORY OHAPTERS. xix

Oswiu himself presidad at this counoil, and besides him were
present his son Alchfrid, who was also a reigning prince3 bishops
Colman and Agilberct, each with a train of clergy 3 Romanus,
the Quean's ohaplain; the venerable J ames, long associated
with Paulinus; and of course the lady Hilda herself. There
is no need here to dwell on the issue of the Synod. It is tha
fact of the Synod itself which arrests the atlantion and fixes
our thoughts for a moment as we prooeed, helping us to realiee
one little scene in the veritable life and action ‘of those days,
and to looalise it as having been enaoted on a stage, tha soenery
ol which our own eyes may be familiar with as belonging to
one of the pleasant places of modern saaside resort.

Nor was it only thus that Streoneshalch was a place of
importance and distinction. The institution from among
whose foster-children a poet like Oaedmon (setting altogether

disoard the tales of andmon's strangely-timed “inspiration‚”
and John's miraoulous performances, as simply due to the
legend-leving temper aud quality of the times wherein the record
was compiled; but there will still remain more than enough to
show that good men and true were working with brain and pen
and hand and life, and that their spirit, and will, and energy of
working were fostered and guided, as well as inspired lrom the
fountain-head of Hilda's monastery at Streoneshaloh.

Hilda appears to have died in the year 680, and she was
succeeded by her royal pupil AElfleda, who, for several years
