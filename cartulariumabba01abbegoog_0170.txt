2Αῑιι, Are, or Ace, filius Wymundi de Lookinton is described in the
Memorial, when his gift of this half carucata in Hoton and two bovatas
in Middeltune is noted, as “nepos Willelmi Abbatis'’ (p. 4). He must
consequently be a blood relation of Alan Buscel's-if his mother was a sister
of Aaliza de Percy, Alan’s mother, of course his first cousin. It is, how·
ever, but a conjecturs, and perhaps even not so probable asto exclude others,
that Abbot William de Percy, Aaliaa de Percy, wife of Boitorp and Buscel
successively, and Wimund’s wife, were brother and sisters. 'l'hat the latter
was sister to Abbot William there can be little or no doubt. But itis
difficolt to see a good reason, assuming that so much is made good bytho
mention of his-specific relationship to the Abbot, why the same relationship,
if it existed, should not have been alleged in the case of Aaliaa de Perci,
who, so far from being spoken of as soror Willelmi, is simply described, and
in two places, as “neptis Willelmi et Serlonis Prioris.” She may have been,
and, so far as the preceding consideration has weight, probably was, the
daughter of another brother, and consequently cousin to Abbot William.

judicial administration, peace and defence, formed what is known as the
liundred or wapealclre.''-(Stubbs's Oonst. Hier. i 96.) The occurrence there·
fore of dues arising out of both hundred and wapentalre seems to chrima
measure of attention. “ The terms wapentake and hundred,” continues
Professor Stubbs, “are both, in Anglo-Saxon records, of somewhat late
occurrence. The wapentakeisfoundonlyinthe Anglian districts, Yorlrshire,
Linoolnshire, Nottinghamshirs, Derbyshire, Rutland, and Leicestershire.
To the north the shires are divided into wards, and to the south into
hundreda. Hence the wapentalre may be a relic of Danish occupatiori. . . .
Tho Norman lawyers explained the word in reference to the formal recogni-
tion of the local magistrate by touching his arms; but this is very question·
able, and the exact origin of the term cannot be ascertained, although it
unquestionably has reference to the armed gathering of the freemen, and so
to the assembly rather than to the district which it represents. The name
