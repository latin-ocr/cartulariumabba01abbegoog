The Domesday statement then is, that the Abbot of York
holds of William de Perci (William de Perci himself beinga
subinfeudatory of Hugh ol Chester, who is the tenant c'c
cupita) Presteby and Soureby, containing, the former two
annuentes, and the latter four, liable tc Danegeld, and by as
purely secular a holding as any other sub-tenant mentioned in
the account of the entire fee. Further, in these two villa there
were two carucates “ in dominico,'’ which alone, out of all the
forty·three carucates comprising the capital manor of Whitby
itself, its herewic Sueten, and its various sokes, formed an
exception to the miserable “omnia wasta'’ applicable to the
rest; and 011 these two carucates eight sochmanni, with the
apparently pitiful equipment ol one plough,1 and thirty villenas
with the more pitiful equipment of three ploughs in all, are
returned as finding employment and maintenance.

In the territory of Prestebi and Soureby then, comprising in
all six carucatas, there were, according to Domesday, two
carucates not waste, and, in so far, unlike all the rest in the
entire manor ; but there is no specification as to the precise
locality of these two carucates, as being situate in one cf the
two vilis rather than in the other, or jointly in hcth3 least of
all, any allegation that they were exclusively in that of Prestebi,
and just as little that these two were held by the Abbot in
frank almoigne.

The statement in the Memorial, in one place, is-—“ dedit
autem illi (Renfrido), strenuissimus praedictus Willelmus de.
Perci antiquum monasterium S. Petri Apostoli, curn duabus
carucatis terrae in Prestebi, in elemosinam perpetuam,'’ the
earlier mention of the same fact having been thus expressed :—
“in loco qui olim Streoneshalc vocabatur, deinde Prestebi
