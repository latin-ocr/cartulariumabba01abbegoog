‘⁶ boon days.” Under the circumstances-au exchange 61 lordship-Oharl-
tou's suppositiou (p. 78) that the former term means ‘⁶ two 611-3613661 161(1”
is clearly inadmissible, and his gratuitous supposition 11161 “hercatorium’'
isa mistake 161 “ hermitorium ’' (io, note) 116 1666 so. Young (p. 302, aud
, 11616) supposes carucata 161611 may be a 166111 61 oren, aud baratarius 1119166-
sas a gang or set 61 harrows, buthe 16 1161 satisfied with either suggestion.

¹ Alanus Magnus, 661 aud heir 61 William Asgernuns.

² A form 61 Fulco, 1161 without interest; the next witness is witness to
N ο. 88, a charter by Falco Dapifer.

³ Richard de Waterville, 1177-1189.

⁴ There is some uncertainty as 16 the connection 61 this lord 61 Everley
with his predecessor 61 predecessore. There is 16666116 believe that Radul·
phus de Everlay, some notice 61 whom, in connection with the legendary
story 61 William (16 Percy’s alienatiou 61 the lands 61 Everley 11611 the new
monastery, in order that he might bestow theru ou his acquire, is 161161 111
the Introductory Chapters, was the first lord 61 Everley under the restored
abbey. His name appears as that 61 a witness 16 several 61 the earliest
documenta iu the Chartulary (Nos. 224, 240, 242, 405), and in the second 61
these the name 61 “ Hugo ejus filius ’¹ follows his, and is itsell followed by‘
that 61 Alanus de Everlaie. Certainly it does not follow that Hugo was his
eldest 661, any more thau does the relationship 61 Alanus de Everlaie.
Assuming1130-5tobethe probable date 61 the charter iu question, it 16
possible, though not perhaps altogether probable‚ that the William de
Everlay 61 this deed 16 the grandson 61 Radullus. Be that as 11 may, heis
the first 61 6 661166 61 Williams de Everley. A second, probably his sou, is
6 cotemporary 61 Abbot Roger (12201244). In Nos. 20, 21, dated 1311,
we meet with another William de Everley, with 6 661 and heir, 6166
William de Everley. Between the cotemporary 61 Abbot Roger and the
elder 61 these two there is 1661116161 11161116116163616161161, possibly
two. M. reads Everley 161 our Everle.

⁵ M. Ugelbarby et Everley.
