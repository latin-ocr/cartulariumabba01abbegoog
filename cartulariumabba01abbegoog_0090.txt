make the suggested hypothesis even moderately plausible. But
it would seem 13 13 otherwise with the supposition that pos·
sibly this sacrifice 31 rights, so highly priped as were the forest-
rights which were surrendered to Hemy, may have been mede
conditionally on the erection 31 an Abbacy in place 31 what
before had been only a Priory. It will be remarked too that
Henry’s charter is an cc pest facte one-‘4 et ego 11133 forestavi
miehi et haeredibus meis? Not only 133 113 3333333133 1333
made by the monks, but the King has already acted upon 11,
by taking all the formal proceedings necessary towards consti·
tnting 113 foresta in question a part 31 113 Royol foresta-—
proceedings which were not reversed, it may be observed, until
the reign 31 J obn, when the reversal was effected by another
special charter (N o. 191).

Whether the suggestion thus made involves or implies the
explanation 31 113 remarkable surrender by the ¹Conveni 31 all
its extensive and important forest-rights 13 the King or not,
must be a matter left 13 113 consideration and judgment 31
3331 33 read these remarks and look upon them as worth enter-
taining3 bnt there is yet another matter for notice, not entirely
nnconnected, and already glanced at,¹ which may as well be
mooted here. I mean that in the existing documents we have
many tokens 31 rearrangement 31 leesor 31 porticus 311333,
soma dependent cn a change in the tenant c'a capita, others on
possible exchange or sale, or, it may be, even cn an entirely
new grant.

Thus 11 13 quite evident that, et the date 31 113 charter by
william de Parcite which not only his wife, Emma de Port,
but specially his son and heir, Alan de Perci‚ is 3 party,
William de Perci himself, as is the case with his son Alan
quite early in Henry'sreign, has become tenant 1333311331-
though we have no hint as 13 113 time or the manner in which
hehad becumene, cr as to any consideration or compensation
made 13 Earl Hugh on that account. But independently 31
this, which could only have been brought about hythe direct
consentand cooperationes 113 King, we find in the seme
charter evidences 31 further change, involving similar royal
action oi even 3 more direct kind still In the extract from
Domesday given above we have a notice 31 the manor 31
