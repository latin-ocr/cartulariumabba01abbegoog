xxiv INTRODUCTORY OHAPTERS.

Stokesley, with 40} carucatas, at ἓ24; end Hutton Rudby,
with 26 carucates also at 024.

Whitby, then-and if we remember that the value of money
then was at least twenty times, probably very considerably
more than twenty times, its present value, we shall perhaps be
better able to realise the absolute condition of prosperity and
wealth enjoyed by the district specified-Whitby, with sen-
sibly less acreage (or carucatage, if such a word be admissible),
was considerably more than twice as valuable, as regards

taxation to Danegeld, as Lofthouse; with a little more extent i
than Stokesley was nearly five times as productive3 and with ῑ
nearly twice as much acreage as Huttcn Rudby, was again κ

nearly five times as productiva. Or, putting it another way: ι
Whitby was geldable to the amount of upwards of ati, 10s. for ’
each carucate in the estimate; Lofthouse at not quite 18s. 10d;
Stokesley at lls. 10d. ; and Hutton Rudby at not quite
Its. cd.

Of course, in the face of such stetistics as these, it is simply
absurd-not to say somewhat discreditable to the historian who
had these historical laets under his eye, and failed to notice
them—to speak oi Whitby, both town and monastery, as
“lying desolate ior nearly two hundred years,'’ and only
“ reviving ’' after the refounding of the Abbey by the Norman
in 107 0, or later. For, really, after making all possible allow·
ance ior the probably greater value of land, in those days also,
when near a place like Whitby, in contradistinction to mere
inland and country places like Lofthouse, Stokesley and
Hutton‚ still we are obliged to leave a large margin for velue
of another kind—such, namely‚ as would depend on civil and
mercantile consideratione. Or, to put it in other words,
Whitby must have been, at the time ol the valuation taken in
King Edward the Confessor's reign, an important, prosperous,
and wealthy town and harbour. Less than this surely cannot
be said of a place which was entered as geldable at, at least,
52000 οο 02250 (and, most likely, a much larger sum) of our
present money.

But in order to confirm this conclusion with even more con·
vincing force, we will enter upon one other calculation, both
brief and ,a little rough perhaps, but in the main neither
