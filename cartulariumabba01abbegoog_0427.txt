OARTULARIUM ABBATHIAE DE WHITEBY. 327

hiis casibus liberi non erunt, scd theloneum sicut 1111111110-
vincia persolvent. (lum autem de animalibus hominum de
Snetcn in dicta villa de Sueton venditis fieri postulassent, huic
dictus Abbas non adquievit.

snxros ARTIOULUS. Petiitque idem Alexander, pro se et hc-
minibus suis, quod filicem in partibus deYburn, etin ejus latere,
metere possent absque irradiatione, quod quidem nec fuit
vetitum nec concessum eis, sed secundum quod se gererent
patiendos,1 utpote, si bene paterentur, sin alias, aliter.

SEPTIMUS ARTIOULUS. Petit idem Alexander fidelitatem sive
servitium debitum ab Abbate proquibusdam terris in campo
de aneton-[cum vero responderemus nos]² nullas terras de
collatione antecessorum suorum nisi puratas et quietas conse·
cutes, non credenti scripta nostra protulimus. Ipsi autern
super aliqua particula haesitantes, ut monumenta quaerentes et
inventa exhibentes,taliter satisfaceremus—quod quidem difficile
erat tam cito monumenta singula invenire, usque alias dilatum
est.

Oersvcs Armenius Cum semper forestarii nostri messana-
rium dicti Alexandri, sive nemorum suorum custodem, arcum et
sagittas deferre prohiberent, ipsas ac saepe auferentes, aliquando
atthachiantes ipsum, non debere 11101 F orestarium sed Wod-
warde asserentes ;—tandem sic conquievit.

¹ 'l'he sense is apparent although the Latin is ,sufficiently halting. The
permission was to depend upon their good conduct ; if they behaved them·
selves they might have the brackens without fine ι if otherwise, not.

² The words within the brackets have been marked out with ink and are
nearly undecipherable. The deleting ink is oi a peculiar tint, and it 11 by
no means apparent either when 01 why such deletion was attempted.

³ This entire sentence again is so corrupt that emendation 11 very difficult.
Hceaiturrti, however, instead 01 hesitantes, to agree with ipsi and governed by
calefaceremus, seems fairly obvious, and taking at as substituted 101 cnm, the
sense probably intended may be extracted. Oharlton’s rendering is-—“To
which it was answered, that we had received no lands from the liberality 01
his ancestors bnt what were free and clear from every service. On their
not allowing this we produced 0111 charters, but they, scrupling some
particulare, and finding fault with these records as the inventione 01 our
own hrains, we gave them 101 answer that every single record was not 10
easily to be met with, so this matter was postponed to another time ;’' the
note being—“Probably the Abbot's book was shewed to Sir Alexander, in
which copies ol all their Charters were contained '’-a surmise as far wide
of the trnth as any 01 those which precede it.
