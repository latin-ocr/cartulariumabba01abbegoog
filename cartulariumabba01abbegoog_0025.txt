begun‚ yet his body was in the sequel buried at Streoneshalch.
The year of his death was 633 ; that of the foundation of the
monastery 65661667. The inevitable conclusion therefore is,
that the burial took place many years before the foundation of
the religious house, and consequently that the place itself, and the
Ohurch (of St. Peter) in which he was buried, were both already
places of mark. Certainly Bede states that AEdwin, as wellas
Ealfleda, with her father and mother, Oswiu and Eanfled, and
many other noble persons, were buried “in St. Peter’s Church
in the monastery ;” but while it was natural enough that Oswiu,
who died about thirteen years after the foundation, and his
queen, and not a few among the principal nobles as well, should
be buried in the monastery, still as no hint is given that
AEdwin's body had been removed from a former resting-place
in order to its deposit in the newly-built monastery, the strong
presumption is that he had been buried at Streoneshalch
immediately after his death, and consequently that Streones-
halch was aheady a place of note.

At all events, no long time elapsed before the pleae became
both famous and important. According to the statement of
William ol Malmesbnry, it was “ the largest of the monasterias
founded by Oswy's bounty,'’ and, as Dr. Young well remarks,
its “increase might naturally be expected both from the rank ¹
and character of the Abbess and the dignity of her youthful
charge. Every one who adopted the monastic life would be
eager to enter an abbey where a lady so illustrious presided,
and where a young princess was a disciple. Oswy and his
queen would be the first to patronise an establishment which
contained an object so dear to them The fame of the lady
Hilda was spread abroad3 she was visited by persons of the
most exalted station, and her monastery became the soene of
important transactions.”1

The “important transaction'’ specially in the mind of the
Whitby historian as he penned those words would naturally be
the famous Synod of Streoneshalch in 663 61 664, summoned

for the purpose of settling the disputes which agitated the early
N orthern Church touching the precise time for keeping Easter,
the priestly tonsure, and one or two minor matters. King
