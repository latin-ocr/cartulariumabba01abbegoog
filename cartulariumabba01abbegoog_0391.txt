¹ lnthe small parish of Hilton, which lies three or four miles a little to tha
south oi west of Yarm, there were in Domesday times two territorial divi·
sione, one a manor of three carucatas extent in “Terra Regis,” and the
other, of six carucatas, of the solre of Tameton, or Semer and Tamcton.
The latter was in the feo of the Earl of Mortain, and passed early in the
twelfth century into the Meinell fee. The former became part of the
original Brus iee shortly before 1087. An offshoot of the Meinill family was
subinfcurled in the one rather early, while tha small manor gave its name to
the subinfeudatory of <ie Brus. Adam de Hilton (or Hylton) was the last
male representative of this family, and his sister, Aliee, marrying Hugo de
Meincll de Hilton, carried both lordships of Hilton into the same family.
Among the dceds in Mr. Meinill’s collection at the Friarage‚ Yam, is one
by Robert rirzMelored, granting “Roberto fil‘ Walt. de hlainill de Ingel·
tona ct haer. suia totam villam de Snoterdnne, etc. . . . sicut continetur in
carta quam idern Rob. frl’ Walteri de Meinell habet de Ada de Hilton, salvo
tamen michi, Rob. filio Meldredi‚ et haer. meis homagio et servitio Atlas de
Hilton et har, suornm‚’' from which it appears that thera was already a con·
· ncction between tho Hilton Meinills and Adam de Hilton. His name is of
very frequent occurrence as a witness in the Gysbnrne decds, and also as
that of a holder (under John fitzWilliam do Bernaldby) of lands in
Barnaby‚ which he gave eventually to Gysbnrne. He ia the representative
² of l'etcr ‹le Brus in 1242 in arranging a fine between the latter and John
¹ Prior of Gysburne touching the Brns granta to tho Priory in arandela, at
·· which time he must have been well advanced in years.
