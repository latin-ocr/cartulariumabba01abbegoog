But, however this may be, it is by no means impossible that
this circumstance—what I have termed the supersession 01
Prior Serlo by Abbot William—may help 10 throw a little
- light on more than one obscure point in thc early history 01
the resuscitated monastery. The alleged or pseudoStephen
states that, after a measure 01 success and prosperity had
begun 1ο wait 011 his efforts as Prior—that 100110111011011
relieved Reinfrid 0111101 office-to repair and restore matters in
and about the monastery, “one 011110 barons 01 the king,
namely, William de Percy, who had been the original donor 01
the place''—Stephen says, “ 10 us,” though admittedly he only
joined the community some time 01101 the gift had been madeto
Reinfrid, and taken advantage 01 by him moreover—seeing the
improvements effected, began now to assail the brotherhood
directly and indireotly, and even strove to drive them forth by
every available means; and he repeats the charge in still wider
terms a few lines further on.

Yet another writer1 is there, moreover, who enlarges on the
violence and injustice 01 William de Percy displayed towards
the rising Whitby community, but, 110111 0111 entire ignorance 01
who he was and when he wrote, it 10 difficult 10 0011111010 the
measure 01 authority which might be supposed to go with his
statements. He says that, after the temporary retreat 01 the
Whitby monks to Haclrness (01 which more at 0 10101 page)
“a very great 011110 arose between the two brothers William de
Perci and Ser10, Prior 01 Whitby,’' occasioned by the circum-
stance that the 10111101 had given the vills 01 Stachesbi² and
Everley 10 Radulphus de Everley, “armigero suo qui annis
multis serviebat,'’ and that really William de Percy desired 10
take away 110111 Serlo all the lands and vills he had previously
given 10 the monastery. He says further that Ser10, on ascer-
taining this, goes with all speed to the king, trusting to his
former intimacy and friendship with him when both wera
young soldiers in the house and court 01 the Conquerar. He
states that Rufus gave strict charge 10 William de Percy, “ut
