afterwards (p. 243) :—“ Among all the particulare contained in the aforegoing
articles, nothing to 100 appears so extraordinary as the building a gold-mill
in that desert place where Rigg-mill now stands, 1110 000 0οᾶ design 01 which
it is difficolt ior us to understand. Whether some doting monk, pretending
10 10010 knowledge than the rest 01 mankind, deluded Sir Alexander with 0
001100 that he had found cut the philosopher-’s etone, and understood the
art 01 extracting gold from some particular metal or mineral; or whether
11110 10111 was intended 101 the making 01 leaf-gold, 00 invention that had
been discovered only about forty years before, Ι leave the curicus 10 judge:
-But whatever was their intention, the scheme, it seems, miscarried, and a
great deal 01 money was wasted, little to the profiter advantage 01 sir
Alexander.'' The last sentence 10 peculiarly characteristic 01 the author, 00
10 0100 the note appended, there being precisely the same amount 01 founda-
tion 101 the one as 101 the other. The note is-“ There is a particular kind
01 grey stone found in some parts 01 our mcor, which, being fluxed, a kind
of yellow metal, very much resembling gold, is extracted therefrom; and
possibly some curicus monk, who was not altogether uuacquainted with
Alchymy, aiter making this discovery, might think he could 1100010010
thie metal into real gold.'' The date 01 the book is 1779, and it is marvel·
loue that 00 author living then, a shrewd man 01 business and 01 consider-
able intelligence, should bring himself 10 believe in 1110 gray stone, iu the
unnamed “kind 01 yellow metal, very much resembling gold,’' extracted
from it, and found the whole romanoe on no mora substautial foundationv
than his own marvellous blunder between the Latin words for a wind-
mill and a gold-mill. ¹ 0110010100010.

accipiant for <accipientes the necessary emendation would bc made·
