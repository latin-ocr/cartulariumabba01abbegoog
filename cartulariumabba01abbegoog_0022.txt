volume, called indiscriminately “The Abbot's Book,'’ “The

Whitby Register‚’' or “The Whitby Chartulary”—which ’

writing dates most likely not much, 11 at all, below 1160, and
is described as the “Memorial of Benefaotions,'' whereas the
newly-founded abbey 11 spoken of as situate “in 1110 qui olim
Streoneshalc vocabatur, deinde Prestebi appellabatur, nunc vero
Witebi vocatur‚’' still the first donation by William de Perci,
the founder, of two carucatas of land-inclusive necessarily of
the site itself-is stated 10 have been at Prestebi3 a statement

which, as 11 apparent, not only involves a contradistinetion ¹

between Witebi and Prestebi in 1070-1111 latter being merely
the ancient (or Anglian) Streneshalc under a newer (namelya
Danish) name—but also proves that the name Witebi of 1150-

1160, when the restored Abbey had become the great distin· ’

guishing or characterismg feature 01 the district, had come 10
be 1 name absorbing within itself‚ and 10 superseding, the older
distinctiva local name 01 Prestebi, just as the latter had 111111,
some two or three centurias before, superseded the still older
name 01 Streneshalch.

For, 11 already intimated, there is no doubt where the
AngloSaxon Monastery stood, and therefore no doubt where
“ the place which used 11 be called Streneshalc'' had its locality‚
evenif the point were not settled hythe short Latin extract

given a little above. The great “kitchen-midding” which is
known 10 exist in 10 many places 11 the 1001 01 the bank above
which slopes the “Almary Field‚'’ is quite sufficient 11 an index
to the site 01 the domestic buildings of the elder monastery3
and, indeed, a very cursory glauce 11 the brae 01 the said bank,
even without the remembrance 01 the runed Angla-Saxon
oomb found there (and now in the local museum), would go

very far towards enforcing· the same conclusion3 it is full 01
the matters which go 10 constitute what is understood by 1
kitchen-midding.

Setting, therefore, side by side the certainty that the ascer-
tained site of Streanaeshalc was a level space girt in for many
hundred yards with precipitous cliffs-in other terms, a
“ heugh ’'—and the philological probability, or more, that balab,
