The facts then are patent that Prior Reinfrid’s son held an
office of distinction in a great family, and that he was suffi-
ciently well leoffed under another great family to he able to
bestow a donation of two carucates upon the rising Ahhey of
Whitby: both of them facts not very consistent with the fore-
gone conclusion ae to the poor estate of the father, antecedently
to his becoming Prior of the reviving monastery of that
place¹

Passing these several consideratione under review, it is seen
to be very difficolt to accord our belief to several of the state·
mente in the narrative of the alleged Stephen. On the iace ol

or Osbert de Archa, held oi him hy Fulco filius Reinfridi Dapiier. But
besides, the following is to be noted :-

“ In Snechintune habuit Blacre i carucatam terra et dimidiam ad galdum,
et i caruca potest ibi esse. Nunc habet Fuleo de Willelmo (de Perci). Ipse
ibi i carucatam et v villanos 3 dimidiam carneam et ii acras prati

‘⁶ In Inglvestvet habuit Gamel viii carucatas tarrae ad galdum, ubi possunt
6666 1111 caruca. Nunc habet Fulcherus de willelmo, et wantum est.''

Thus Fulcho appears to have held largely under both familias, de Perci
and de Arois.

¹ There is 6 remarkable entry in Dodsworth, vol. ii. p. 2¹³, which may
possibly throw some light on the birth and extraction of Prior Reinfrid lt
is involved in the following transcript :—

“earta 31 Edw. i. m. 1.

“Rex omnibus etc. Inspeximus cartam Henrici Regis, patris nostri, in
haec verbm-Heminae, Rex Angliae, etc. Sciatis nos confirmasse eeclesia
Sanctae Mariae et monialibus de Appleton etc, Ex dono Aliciae dc Sancto
Quintino scitum loci eta: Ex dono Roberti, filii Roberti filii Fulconis, filii
praedicte Aliciae de S. Quintino5 terras in Immingham: Ex dono Roberti
Dapileri et Roesire uxoris suae ecclesiam de North Elkington: Ex dono
willelmi de Kyma xxx acras t’rae in Elkington‚ cum communi pastura
quantum pertinet ad ii bovatas t'rae ejusdem villae. Has autem xxx acras
t’rae dedit eis pro ii bovatis quas Robertus Dapiler, pater Margaretae, uxoris
sum, eis dedit die obitus sui. Dat. Α0 regni nostri xxxiii.’'

Το this Dodsworth appende a short genealogical table, showing that Alicia
de St. Quintin was daughter to Aymer de Arches, founder oi the monastery
of Keeling, and that hersen Fulcho was iatharof Robert and Gilbert. But
Fulcho filius Reinlridi is father oi Robert and Gilbert also; and the proba-
bility is, as Roesia was a widow in 4 Henry 111. [Η,Η.Η. 55] (1223), and
thus the dates would accommodate themselves fairly well, that the lludcho
mentioned in the above Confirmation is also the son of Reinfrid, and that
thus some further elcw to the condition and connectione oi Prior Reinlrid is

given ns.
