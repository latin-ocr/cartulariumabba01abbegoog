by Archbishop Roger (Nos. 44 and 55), in the present volume.

² Appointed1203-11219. Le Neve (iii. 230) says, “Bernard, according
10 Godwin‚ succeeded Aldulf 00 Bishop 01 Oarlisle, but neither the time 01
his accession nor that 01 his death is known. Godwin supposes that he died
in 1186, as Hoveden states that when Henry 11. was at 0011101011111101 year,
‘he caused one Paul 01 Leeds to be elected Bishop 01 00111010, who declined
the dignity.’ The 1010 Μ1. King (Haadbools of 110001110011010, p. 220) says
Adeluli was bish0p1133-1156, aud that, “ 01101 the death 01 Adeluli the
succession 01 Bishops becomes very uncertain. A certain Willism is named
as Bishop 0100111010 in 1174, and 101 some time the sae was vacant, probably
owing 10 110 scanty endowment, until 1203, when Bernard, who had been
Archbishop 01 Ragusa, was appointed to it. The year 01 his death is un·
known. In 1219 Hugh, who had bean Abbot 01 Beaulisu, was Bishop, who
continued till 1223.” y

Le Neve, in 0 note, adds, “Thera is considerable doubt whether thare
ever was a Bishop called Bernard. The mistahe seems to have arisen from
the 1001 that Bernard, Archbishop 01 81010110, had a grant 01 the revennae
from King John ;¹’ and in the text he says, “The See appears 10 have been
vacant until the appointment 01 Hugh, Abbot 01 Beaulieu, as Bishop 01
00111010 in 1218. Β111, during the long vacaney, King John grsnmd the
revenues 01 the See 10 the Archbishcp 01 Slavonia in 1200, and in 120510
Alexander de Lucy. The custody 01 the See was also granted to Aymery,
Archdeacon 01 Durham, and afterwards, in the same year, to the Prior 01
00111010.” But, 110111 the documenta now before us, thera can bnt little
doubt be 1011 that there was a Bishop Bernard iulfilling episcopal duties
The date 01 the present deed, from the facts as 10 time connected with the
witness who stands second in order (Symon¹ Dean 01 Yorlr), must be anterior

101214. “ ³ 1111111αώ110.
