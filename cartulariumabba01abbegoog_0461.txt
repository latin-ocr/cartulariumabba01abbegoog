new series of publicatione under ihe old nume und upon ihe
old lines, bul with a fresh numbering ond some other hohen
oi differenoe. The siook oi the old publioaiions in ihe
possession oi the Sooiety is so greatly reduced that, it is
by no means easy, and iu will soon be impossible, ‘oo supply
full sets of our works to any new members who may wish to
nequire them.

In Sir Walier Oolverley Trevelyon the Sooiety hns lost,
it moy be said, one of its founders, o gentlemon who ‘lor
more than half a century hasbeen o friend of scholare, ond
a sympathizer und helper in hierony work throughout ohe
N orth of England. There ore now but four names upon our
liei oi members which stood there ab the foundation oi the
Society in 1834.
