Walesgrif, with the Berewic of Nordleld, as apert 01 the
Terra Regis, and, appertaining thereto, soke 01 Το1110111;
Sndleld and Everlaye being mentioned as in William de

Perci’s see at Hackness, either as parts 01 oppurtenances
But the charter under note, after detailing the granta and
donations made at and near Whitby, and also of Hackness and
the two churches there, goes on in immediate connection to
specify as follows :—“ Et Norleld et Sndfelt‚ Everlaye et Broke-
saye et Tornelaye oum omnibus ad easdem villas pertinentibus.”
It is to be presumed, therefore, that in the rearrangement‚ as it
was just now termed, 01 leesor portionsof sees, which must
have taken place after the date 01 Domesday, and probably
in the earlier years 01 the second William's reign, the King had
over and above, 01 independently 01, his own royal gift 01 two
carucates in Haokness, four carucatas in Nordfeld, and two in
Burniston‚ made over to William de Percy, to be 101 the future
appnrtenant to his manor 01 Hackness, all rights whatever
involved in the soke 01 these geographioal portione of that
plaoe; and I think there can be but little doubt that such
surrender was made with the distinct object 01 enabling William
de Percy formally to make good the Abbey’s title 10 the whole
district embraced within the limits 01 what is now called the
Parish 01 Haokness.l

lt is scarcely necessary to follow this inquiry much further.
From the time Alan de Percy begins to grant charters on his own
sole account, and Royal chartei succeeds Royal charter, the early
history 01 the restored Abbey, though the materials are meagre,
becomes fairly free from the doubts and uncertainties consequent
on such inconsistencies and contradictione as these we havehad
to deal with. Grants, donatione and concessions flowed in
rapidly and from many different sources during the reign 01
Henry 1., and Ithink especially during the early part 01 11,
and possibly the later years 01 William the Second’s3 and
copies 01 many 01 tho charters conveying such granta and oon·
cessione are yet extant, attempta at illustration of which in
respect 01 probable approximate dete, noteworthy particulare
in the biography 01 the grantors, features 01 interest or curio·

¹ lt should be observed that Burniston, or the carucatos granted bytho

Conqueror in 11111 township, 11 not once named in the Priory granta or
confirmations.
