xl INTRODUCTORY cHAPvnRS.

The statement in the Memorial¹ is that Reinfrid, while 1
he was yet a very energetic soldier (“ miles strenuissimus '')²in “
the service of the Conqueror, during a journey or march through ς
N orthumbria‚ turned asida to visit 'Streoneshalch and that ha ’
was pricked to the heart at the tekene of ruin and desolation j
which obtruded themselves on his notice there3 that thereafter, ,J
having become a monk at Evesham, and having been well f*
trained at that convent in monastic discipline, he finally ⁴
returned under the Divine guidance into Northumbria,ir ⁷
company with Aldwine, Prior of Winchcumbe‚ and the morl „
Elwine, and with the avowed intention of reviving the monkish '
profession in the aforesaid district. ᾗ

Ipause here ιο remark that all this is perfectly consistent
with the narrative of Symeon of Durham, according ιο whom Ι
Aldwine,a Mercian presbyter, and prior of the monastery ol h
Winoelcumbe, animated by a desim to visit a scone so famous -
as Northumbria had been for monastic piety, and ιο become
himself an emulator of the ancient solitarias in the same dis· ³
trict, repairs ιο Evesham monastery, and induces two memben
of the society there ιο join him in his plan and undertaldng. ⁵
One of these was the presbyter Elfwy, the other a man named
Reinfrid, who is described as being “ignarus litterarum''-s .
character which precisely suits the man whose career had been -
such that he could be fittingly spoken of as “miles strenuissi-

¹F0r myself‚ and for the reasons briefly stated here, but which will
become more apparent as we proceed,l am disposed to attach almost oom-
plete credit ιο the statements in question. They are quite consistant with
each other; they are consistent with, or corroborated by, those in other
writings which are known to be worthy of credit; they are to a very great
degree corroborated by the existing Charters and other like documenta oon·
nected with tha Abbey‚ and in no case discredited by them3 and thayms
contradicted by, or inconsistent with, only the statements made in a writing
which is of doubtful authority‚il not uncertain origin, tho said statements
or assertione involving issues which are not consistent with such other, will
’ known facts, or with common sensa and reason.

2 I do not dwell on the possible force of the word “miles” or intend to
claim for it the meaning it would undoubtedly bear two or three generations
later. But Ι would ask attention ιο the fact that the sams term is applied,
iotha course of the seli-same Memorial, ιο Alauda Munceus, who vas ι
certainly no mere parocias, but a man of distinction.
