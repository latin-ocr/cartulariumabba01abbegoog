of the Conventio between the houses of Gyseburn and Whitby,
made in the presence of Robert de Brus (No. 271), and to which,
moreover, the same baron, conjointly with the Convent of
Whitby, was a party, is sufficiently remarkable. The dispute
was touching “ totam decimam et omnes parochianas consuet -
dines ad ecclesiam de Midlesburg pertinentes de xii carucatis

latin-“Hunc finem et concordiam inter predictos canonicos et monachos
concessit et confirmavit ex sua parte Capitulum Canonicorum de Gisebumia,
et Capitulum Monachorum de Wytebi et Robertus de Brus ex parte sua”-
in the following words :—“ This conclusion and agreement between the
aforesaid canons and monks was allowed of, and confirmed on the one
part (ἱ) by the Chapter of the Canens of Giseburn and the Chapter
of the Monks of Whitby, and on the other part (l) by Robert de
Brus.” Suroly ignorant and blundering misconception could no further
go, and we may hold ourselves quite prepared to find that Charlton
(p. 52) notices the charter hitherto more immediately in question, thus ε
-“ Also Hugh Earl of Chester granted them the following charter,” append·
ing a translation which is slightly incorrect in two particulars, and then
proceeding-“ By this charter it appears that the Earl of Chester did not
at first surrender to Lord William de Perci all right and title he had to those
lands, eta, that lay about Whitby, nor convey them to him absolutely as
freehold3 bnt either reserved a part, or else, as Lord Paramount, received
some quittent, homage, or service for the whole.'’ Thon follows one of the
author's characteristic reckless and utterly baseless statements to the effect
that, on these grounds, may be partly understood the residence of ‘⁴ Percy
for many years at Sneton before he granted anything by charter to the
monastery of Whitby l’' After which he proceeds to say- ‘⁴ However those
lands were all ceded to him as frechold before he entered into the crusade,
aud they are mentioned as such by his son Alan not long after that time.
As for Flambrough ’'-and again we meet with an utterly groundless asser-
tion-“ narl Hugh, soon after the Conquest, settled a colony of Flanderkins
or Flemings in those parts, who built a church and town there ς and from thern
it took the denomination of Flammenville, Flammeville, Fleinesburgh, or
Flamborongh, by some of which names it has been known ever since.'' And
this, to say nothing of the gratuitous confusion between the two names
Flamfflavilla and Fleinesburg-Flaneburg in Domesday-notwithstanding
the distinct statement in the record j ust named that the place in question not
only had its name and local designation in Edward the Confessor's time,
but was then a thriving manerium, geldable in no less asum than 224, and
held by no less a personage than “Harold Comes.'' Moreover, all the
special notice conceded to the most noteworthy matter in the whole
transaction-the alleged grant of a church and its appurtenanees, which
transparently never was so given-is the following sentence :-“ The church
there (at Flamborough) was in the next century ceded (l) to the Priory of
Bridlington, but on what consideration does not appear.”
