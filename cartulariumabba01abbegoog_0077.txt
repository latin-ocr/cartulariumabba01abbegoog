lxx INTRODUOTORY OHAPTERS.

would bring us to 1082, in which year William came to Eng-
land from Normandy to arrest the Bishop oi Baieux, returning ,
thither again not long after. I note this because the next ·
important feature in the tale, as told by the alleged stephanis
that William de Perci, after this double consecrationes Stephen
as Abbot, became more virulently and actively hostile than
ever to these unhappy religione, and strove by all possible
means to expel the community from Whitby; on which
account the Abbot had repeated recourse-“ frequenter adire
compulsus est '’-to the justiciars, dinned his troubles into the 3
ears of many, asking ot them help against his oppressore, ἶ
actually crossed over to Narmandy in order to have an audi· ²
ence of the King, and finally, confronting William de Perei
there, besought the royel succour against him. And so, at
last, having accomplished his purpose—“accepto pacis chiro·
grapho ’'—he returns horne. But the peace was oi short dura·
tion. William de Perci showed himself more fiercely hostile
and bent upon their ruin than ever; and, in the haue, suc·
ceeded in openly effecting their expulsion ,

But surely all this must carry us on a year or two further
in the passage of time; and thus, on our very modest assump
tions es to the space citime required, we come to an epoch
which can certainly with no reason be supposed to antedate
the Domesday inquiry by much more than a couple of years,
within which period the appointment and consecration aa Abbot
of York must necessarily be made, and moreover the grant and
concession, and by the very baron represented as so implacably
hostile, of the landa oi Prestebi and Sourebi, he formally made
to the object oi his hitherto persistent and bitter persecution.¹ ÷

¹ The suspicion has cemainly crossed my mind that there might bea
possible connection between the Domesday statement and the mention in
Stephen's narrative oi his appeals to the justiciars and others. But inde·
pendently oi the iact that the whole narrative appears to me to be open to
so much and so grave suspicion, I cannot see any good ground for enter·
taining any such idea. In other words, I have no doubt that the Domesday
entry recorda a bona fide tenancy, and that it isis understood to applyto
the grant oi lande by William de Penei, entirely destructive oi any iaithin
thav veracr ty oi that part oi the alleged Stephen's narrative which speaks oi
the charch- lande at Whitby as being publicly and uniuatly torn irem the
eommunity oi religione ao recently revived,
