(63¹³) Everardus de Ros, Roberto fratri suc,⁶ et omnibus paren-

¹ M. Dulieildehalc. In A. the name looks rather like Dulicildeha103 but
there can be little doubt that the letter is a and not 11.

² M. Scortebuttes.

³ ’1119 witnesses' names 919 911 in the nominative. Son 01 Alen de Percy
and grandson 01 William Asgernons.

⁴ M. Bradelay. No other witnesses.

⁵ These 919 necessarily the two carucatas in Briningeston (or Burniston)
given 10 the renascent monastery by King William, and repeatedly con·
firmed by his successore, and which, 01 equal necessity, had been granted in
fee to the author 01 11119 deed ata very early period, inasmuch as the present
deed 01 release must date 99 191 back 99 1150-1160, 01 thereabouts, 911119
latest, the names 01 the witnesses being a sufficient attestation to 11191 1901.

⁶ Dugdale throws no light upon the identity 01 the grantor. H 9 speaks
01Ρο191, “the ancestor 01 the great and noble family'’ 01 Ros or Roos of
Hamlake‚ and 01 his benefaction to St. Mary’s Abbey at York, his marriage,
etc, and then proceeds to his son Robert, who, as he states, iu 3 Henry 11.
(1151), gave to the King 1000 marks for livery 01 the lands 01 Walter
Espee, 01 1119 mother Adeline’s inheritanee. Naming Robert de Ros’ wife,
Sibylla de Valoines, he simply says he 1911 by her 9 son and heir, Everard,
who was a minor at his father’s death, and 9 ward 01 Ranulph de Glanvill in
12 Henry 11. He held 01 the King eight knights' 1999 aud 911911, and in
22Henry11. paid 9 fine 01 11526 101 his lande, etc. This, 01 course, throws
him much too late to admit 01 identification with the present grantor. The
most probable assumption is that, besides Robert, Peter had another son,
Everard, and that the Everard and Robert 01 the present deed 919 the said
two sons. The probable, or rather approximate, date 011119 deed, 90191
from being inconsistent with such a theory, lende much probability to it.
