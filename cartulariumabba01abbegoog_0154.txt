⁴ A name of doubtful form.

⁵The large capital at the head of this daed, in red, is R. A smaller
capital, G, is inserted close after it. The heading leaves no doubt of what
the letter should be. As ιο the identity of the person intended, it would
seem difficnlt, and perhaps unnecessary, ιο identify him with the Guy de
Balio] named by Dugdale, and of whom he says that, “in the reign of Wil-
liam Rufus, he was enfeoffed by that King in tbe barony of Biwell in Nor·
thumberland,'’ adding further—and by such addition bringing him into
local connection with the place named in the charter-that he ‘⁴ gave to the
Abbey of S. Mary at York the church of Stolresley and one carucata cl
land.'’ After another sentence or two, describing other donatione ιο S.
Mary’s, Dugdale proceeds, “the next was Bernard Baliol, son of Gay, who,
in 3 stephan, upon that great invasion by the Scots, met at uhrah, through
the instance of Thurstan, Archbishop of York, with other of the Northern
barone, ete.’¹ Now the next charter (No. 53) is granted by Bernard de
Baliol, but it will be observed that he speaks of Guido de Baliol-doubtless
the Guido of the present charter—as his brother, and not as his father. Hence,
aa Bernard de Balio] is in 1138 the important man Dugdale's notice proves
him to be, and as the Guy de Baliol of this charter was his brother, it would
appear to be a safe, if nota necessary, inference that the Guy de Baliol cf
William Rufus’s time had a son Guy as well as ason Bernard, and elder than
Bernard, but that he died early and without heir, leaving his inheritance ιο
his brother Bernard, were it not thatin No. 353 aGnido de Balliol appears
at the head of the witnesses to a charter by this same Bernard de Balliol.
Guido therefore must either have been the younger brother, subinfeuded ιο
Bernard, or have ceded his rights. A further necessary inference is as to
the date of the gift by Adam filius Viel or Vitalis, noted in charters 51-54,
as well as in others: it must have been before 1138. Dugdale quotes Ber-
nard as still serving valiantly in arms in 20 Henr. 11. (1172), as giving certain
landa to the Knights Templars, with the consent of his son Ingelram, and es
