xliv INTRODUCTORY CHAPTERS.

of Sir Ο. Stricklaud’s MS, and in which, with greeting to
Arohbishop Thomas of York, William de Perei, and He[nry]
‘Vicecomes Ebor.,’ he granta to Prior Renfrid the Ohurch ol S.
Peter at Whitby, with all its appurtenances, and to that same
ehurch, the Ohurch of Fleinesburg alec, “ cum omnibus decimis
Francigenis et Anglicis;'' the witnesses being Earl Alan (ol
Bretagne), Ralph Paganel, Aschetil de Bulmer, Robert de Bruis,
and Gislebert fitzAdelard.

The mention of the church of Fleinesburg in thie charter
is held to throw doubt on its authenticity. But there are
matters and consideratione connected with or involved in the
charter itself of such a nature as necessarily to infer its essen·
tially genuine and authentic character. And in this connection
I ask attention first for the specified grant of tithes—“cum
omnibus decimis Francigenis et Anglicis ''-accompanying that
of the ehurch, and then to the fact that just such a grant was
assuredly made by Earl Hugh to Whitby, of achurch with its
tithes, if not at Fleinesburg yet at Midelesburg, which specific
grant, however, seems to have missed any particular notice

at the hands of either Chariton or Young.l For the language

both because no notice is alterward taken in our records of the Ohureh of
Flamborough, . . . and because the chartei in question has not been among
those that were first written in the Whttby Regieter, but has afterwards been
inserted in a different handwriting on a blank space that has been left attha
bottom of a page.’'-(Wbitty, p. 252, n.) The consideration or objection
last named does not carry much weight with it: it is equally valid—or the
reverse-against every other similarly inserted chartei· in either of the two
copies in the Ohartulary (or indeed in any other) ς aad the number oi such
inserted documenta in either volume is very considerable, as surely was to
be expected when one remembers the way in which these transcripta were
made, and the avowed excludor, at the time of copying, of many documenta
in their proper places. The other objection is dealt with in the text

¹ Charlton misreads and miseonceives the important document noticed in
the next paragraph ol the text, and which ought to have arrested his special
attenti0n; and misreads and misconceives it in more than one important
particular. To specify but one :-'l'he conventio noted was made in settle-
ment of a disputa between the canons of Gyseburn and the monks ol
Whitby, the former being the setters forth of the calumpnia or claim. The
two parties to it, therefore, must necessarily and of course be the said
monks ol the one part, and the said canons of the other part. Notwith·
standing which selfevident proposition, Charlton trandates the clause
stating the settlement and agreement made, which is thus expressed inthe
