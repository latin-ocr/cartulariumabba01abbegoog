who had to render the service of making the Homgarth is effectually dis·
posed cf. lt was Alexander de Percy's “men” (homines), and not himself,
who had to do the work. That tbe hedge or fence, whatever its object, aud
substantially made, as wc have seen, began or ended near the place where
the present farcical sticking in of small sticks is performed is not at all iur-
probable; and that it was of dimensione and extent adaquata to the purposes
for which hedges made of strong stakes, with wattled brushwood between,
are usually constructed, is quite beyond doubt. Taking into consideration
the time ol year at which the work had to be donc, there can, it seems, be
but little doubt that it was the customary annual restoration of the fence of
the common arable lands of the Abbey, after the completion of the spring-
sowing‚ and that the fence was one designed to resist the incursione of
¹ ‘horned cattle as well as of sheep, goats, and swine. It is reasonable to sup
pose that in the vicinity of such a town as Whitby undoubtedly grew to be
under the Abbey, and particularly when we bear in mind the many special
permissione conceded to the Abbey to enclose the land granted to them, ifso
they desired, the need for such annual restoration would grow less and
less, and disappear long before it did in more country places. But the service
itself, aud its name, would still remain (as is the case to this day with nota
few feudal services in many parts of the kingdom), aud notwithstanding thc
formal relaxation which evidently took place, or perhaps because of that
very relaxation‚ at some time in the sixteenth century probably, a myth
would be invented to account for both one and the other. As to the name
itsell, as a name only :-ol course the Abbot’s bailiff may have formally sum-
moned the service-bound builders of the hedge by sound of horn, and the
old horn itself remains to attest the antiquity of the custom, in its existing
form, by its frail and battered condition, albeit there is nothing about the
said horn to suggest a greater antiquity than, if so great as, that assigned a
few lines above to the legend itself It may possibly be a sixteenth century,
it certainly is not a twelfth century, relic. If the Abbot's bailiff did thus
formally summon the builders-although there is uo reference to the fact iu
the record of the settlement with Alexander de Percy, and although itis
quite certain from the same record that the actual, or dc facto, summoue or
warning was otherwise made—for de Percy’s men often made a claim to
have a three days' warning-the name might so originale. But it is not
likely. And certainly it isat least as likely that its first clement came from
the horned stock-and the great quantitics of horus that have beeu dug up
in the Monastery kitchen-midding, at the foot of the bank on the Abbey side
of Ohurch Street‚amply show that, and how, the said stock were berned-which
pastured over the stubbles after harvest was gethercd in, and the hitherto
protecting hedges pulled down, and which were again excluded on the return
of spring from the newly·sown lands by renewed or repaired feuces in each
returning year.
