carry out, his plans for the erectiones an Abbacy in place of
the hitherto existing Priorate.

As to the time when this change was finally carried out,
although there are no precise dates available to us, still I think
there are facts and considerations such that a safe inf'erence
may be founded upon them; and also perhaps a further infer-
ence as to a part, at least, 01 the considerations by which the
Royal consent to such a change was induced.

ln a note 011 a previous page it was observed that it
seemed much more than simply apparent that there were at
least two periods at which donatione 10 the rising Abbey
were made hythe Founder,-the first on or about the date ol
Reinfrid's arrival and commenced work at Whitby, which may
without violence be held to include the much more than only
possible augmentatione conceded on occasion 01 1113 brother’s
admission into the number 01 the monks; the second, that
which is marked hythe still extant charter in which 1113 wif ,
1113 heir, and two other sons 010 named as “concessores''
together with himself, 03 wellas acting as witnesses to his
grant. That this charter was granted after the commencement
of 1110 reign of the second William, is patent from the fact that
he is named in it 03 reigning at the time3 but at what particular
period in that reign there is nothing in the charter itself posi·

tively 10 indicate. Nevertheless, it would almost seem possible
to infer the probable (101001 least approximately, from some
considerations suggested partly by historical fact, and partly by
the wording 01 the charter. The Founder, it is known-at

least the statement to that effect is not disputed-took part in
the Orusade 01 1096 ; and, according to the Memorialist‚ died
on the march 1ο Jerusalem 01 0 place called “Mons Gaudium,'’
within what 110 00113 “the province 01 J erusalem.’' This would
be, 01 course, after the rendezvous at Constantinople in 1097,
but how long after there is no means of knowing, nor is it
material. What there is that it 13 to our purpose to remark 13,
11101 William de Perci's last and enlarged grant must have been
made before he set out to join the orusading host, and most
likely before he began to make his final preparatione for so
formidable an expedition. Indeed, no more plausible suggestion
can well be made than that the resolution to take part in the
orusade, and the resolution to 01001 an Abbey at Whitby in
