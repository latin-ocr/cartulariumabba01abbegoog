lxxviii INTRODUOTORY OHAPTERS.

That such supersession did actually take place 1 think there
can be but little doubt. There is a charter by Nigel de Albini
(Νο. 261), the date 01 which lies between llos-1114, by which
the grantor restores (“ reddidit ”)1 10 eod and the Ohurch 01 All
Saints in Fishergate at York, a certain half carucate 01 land at
Thorp, with the explicit direction that Serlo the Prior and the
other monks 01 that same place (“ Serlo Prior et alii monachi
ejusdcm loci’') should have and 110111 the same. Α1111111010110
remarked that while Whitby 10 001 00 1011011 00 named, or even
alluded to, in the terme employed, the Church 01 All 801010,
which it will be remembered had bean granted by Rufus 101
the establishment 01 0 0011 there, is both named and described
with 1001011100 theusual precision :—“ Deo et ecclesia Omnium
8000101100.. . sedicet ecclesiae qnae est in Fisergate apud
Eboracum.'' There can therefore be no doubt at 011 as to the
position Prior 80110 held attha time 01 this grant. The phrase
“ et alii monachi ejusdem loci '’ 0011 be understood but 10000
way. 80110 had 0000011 10 be Prior of Whitby,2 and had become
simply Prior 01 the Oell at the Ohurch 01 All 801010 111 110111.1

Now, such 0 change as this could ha've occurred but in 000
01 two ways—either by consent 01 80110, 01 against his will,
and 00 the result 01 1011110000 brought to bear upon him 01
such 0 0011110, whether moral or compulsory, that he was

whether merely that 01 his own conscience or otherwise applied, the burden
01 which is restitution 01 lands alienatori from different Religious Houses, or

it is to be inferred, unjustly deprived, 0011 among the former we find what is
no doubt the 11011 carucata mentioned in the text. Thechsrter 10 curione, ss

Priory into 00 Abbatial House will be iound at a future page.

³ In 01000 connection with this conclusion it 10 001 001 01 place to remark
that 01 0 subsequent period in the history 01 the Abbey, in fact 001 liity
years later, a precisely similar retirement took place. When Abbot Benedict
resigned in 1148, we are told that the 00111 Benedict, with the unanimous
consent 01 the chapter 01 1000110, took up his permanent abode at All Saints’
Call-“permansit in ecclesia Omn. Sanctorum in Fiehergate 0001111010-
cum’' (No. 3).
