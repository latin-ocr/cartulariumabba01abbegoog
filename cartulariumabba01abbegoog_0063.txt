them they are not consistent with either reason or probability ;¹
and inasmuch as they are inconsistent with the statements of
other writers whose accuracy and acquaintance with the facts
concerned, apart from the narrative itself, there is no reason to
suspect, there can be little hesitation in rejecting them as

incredible, perhaps even in discrediting them as fictions, if not
falsehoods.

On the whole, then, we assume the material truth and
accuracy of the statements of the Whitby Memorialist touching
Reinfrid, his priorate, its unbroken continuity‚ his death as
recorded, and, what should not be omitted, his burial at Hack-
ness ; and, continuing to pay attention to the said narrative,
we are informed that, after Prior Reinfrid’s death, SerIo, the
brother of William de Perci‚ was invested with the vacant
office, and remained in it until their nephew, William de Perei,
was created Abbot.⁸ And it is also notioed that the creation
in question took place at some undefined time before William
de Perci went to the Holy Land.

Dr. Young in speaking of the events here recorded, simply
says, “ Serlo was succeeded by his nephew, William de Percy,
who obtained the title of Athos? having at a previous page

¹ It 'may be remarked that the same character appertaina to several of the
statements made in that part of the narrative which bears immediate reler-
ence to the proceedings connected with the foundation and endowments ol
St. Mary’s Abbey at York. 'l'here is much oi inconsistency and improba·
bility involved, which this, however, is nottho place to expoae.

² The view I am inclined to take of this compositionis perhaps indicated
in the terms employed in describing it in the text, as that oi “the clueat
Stephen.’' ln other words, I do not feel inclined to look upon it in its
existing form aa emanating from Stephen at all, or as originating in Stephen's
time, or indeed at any period very near his time. On the contrary, it looks
much more like the production of some admirer of Stephon, whose object it
was to add distinction tobis name, and who, with some amount of real
knowledge-whether derived from tradition or from writtensouross—drev
upon his imagination also, and was besides not too careful to avoid local
and other inaccuraciea and inconsistancies. Regarded, therefore, aa in con-
nection with Stepheu as its author, 1 look upon it as a forgery.
