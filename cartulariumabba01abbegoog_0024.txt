INTRODUOTORY OHAPTERS. xvll

early ohurch thus presupposcd, and ol its connected buildings,
are all concealed in utter obscurity. Probably it was origi-
nally a rude, rather than merelya plain, structurc; very likely,
in the first instance, framcd of split tnmks of trees adjusted
side by side so as to give a partially smooth surfaoe within,
with thatoh of straw or rushes, and side-lights only partially
secured by slight lattioe-work of split wood. And, no doubt,
the dwellings for the abbess, her nuns, and the servants of the
house, would be in accordante with the early rudeness of the
ohurch itself‚ not better but rather worse, or more rude and
inartistio.

Still it must be borne in mind that the place was neither
unknown nor unnamed. Although discarding, as utterly without
support, Young’s ideas that “ there cannot be a doubt Whitby
was a place of some importance under the Roman Govemment ’'
(conceding, however, that “their coasting vessels may have fre·
quented the harbour'’), and that Dunsley Bayis the Dunum
Sinus of Ptolemy1-f0r the soarcity of Roman relies at Whitby,
in common with the rest of Oleveland, is so marked as to call
for special regard,-I hold it to be a reasonable supposition
that the scafaring folk who occupied the district subsequently
to the departure of the Romans from Britain (even if not for
some considerable time before) would not be slow to note, and
to improve, the natural advantages presented by the harbour
as well as the soil. In other words, I cannot but think that
Streoneshaloh, when Hilda availed herself of Oswiu’s pious
donation, was already a place not only of some importancc, but
one in which what in these modern days is implied by the
word “progress” was certainly by no means unknown. And
from other considerations I think it was, as elsewhere reinarkcd,
already a place of some celebrity. For, although after the dis-
astrous battle of Haethfclt, in which King AEdwin lost his life,
the head of the slain monarch was taken to York, and eventu-
ally deposited in the Ohurch of St. Peter, which he had himself

¹ I discard the surmise as to the Dunum Sinus as incorrect. The first ·
portion of this name (Dumclciu) is clearly identical with the Dun in such
place names aa Dunesdene, Dunesford, Dunestal, Dunestone, Dunesbi, Dune-
torp, Duntune, all from Domesday, and there is little doubt that the nemeis
