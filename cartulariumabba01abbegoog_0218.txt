¹ In the Memorial (p. 3), where thereis a corresponding list to this in
tho present document, we find “Nebrebi id est Steinsecher;” here Staiu-
secher is separated from Niderbi, and, without doubt, wrongly so. In the
same way, what in the Memorial is “Gnip, id est Hauchesgard,” is in thir
deod resolved into two separate places. The identification ol the Memoria!
may surely be taken in both instanees. Stainsacre then, at the present time,
represents Netherby or Niderbi.

² Charlton, without comment, gives High Whitby as the site cf Overby.

³Thingwala in the Memorial. One of the most remarkable, ii not
actually the most remarkable, oi all the words or names in the Obartnlary·

It remained ior the editor of the present volume to be the first to eall aben· i
tion to it. In the Gloasorp of tte Clevehaed Dialem, Introd. p. 12, note, ht
writes—“ This nemeis so marked that it ie difficolt to conceive it should
never have attracted attention from any local historiari or antiquar-y heieu.
‘Tingwall hvor‚ som navnet (tinga vollr) antyder‚ demes Hovedthing
gjennem Aarhundreder blev holdt‚’ as Worsaae says of the famous Thngval Ξ
ol Shetland‚ are words fully as expressive, beyond doubt, and as capable ol
application in the case of the Whitby Thingwala, as in Chester, Orkney, nos·
shire, or Shetland itself. It was, as surely as in these other casea the
hoveclttiny, or prineipal politieal and judicial maetingplace ior the district3
aud it speaks very intelligibly oi the extent to which the district was not
only under the influenee of, but inhabited by, meu oi Northern or Danish
origin, that such a place of meeting should have existed in Oleveland.”

⁴ harpool.

ὃ “This is that dale through which a nameless beck runs, which emptio
itsell into the Esk at Spital Bridge.”—(Oharlton, p. 69, note.) See mention
made of itin No. 572.

⁶ M. Bertuait. The site unknown. Sctwait is mentioned next in order
in the Memorial, but is omitted here.

⁷ M. and A. both read Bilrod 3 Bilroche elsewhere: now Billery.

⁸ According to Charlton, identical with Sneaton-Tborp.

⁹ Baldbyfields ; known by that name till lately, if not still 3 lying ou the
slope on the right hand as one leaves the Statiou by train.

¹⁰ Uncertain. Charlton says, “probably erosa-Butes? Breein hl.

¹¹ Stereotyped in Flowergate.
