²From the return by William de Percy of the knights infeuded in bis
ise, early in the reign oi Henry 1.‚ printed above (p. 31), it is seen that
William ds Argentom held one knight’s fee in Upleatham and Lolthus.
llrom the Memorial (p. 7) it appears that Robert de Argentom was the
original donor of the two bovates mentioned in this charter, which identifies
him as the father ol William de Argentum, tbe grantor. But there was
also an early benefactor of Whitby in the person oi Walter de Argentom,
who gave two bovates in South Loithouse‚—the entry in the Memorial
(p. 7) being, “ ex dono Walt. de Argentum et Will. de Perci de Drmeeleia ct
Aalizae matris suae.'' From No. 74 it appears that Walter de Argentum
had been Athaliza or Aaliza's first husband; as also that she had been the
actual donor of the two bovates in Lolthus. Whence the inierence is that
it was out of her dower, as Soutb Lofthus was in the Percy lee from a very
early period. Cotemporary with the grantor of No. 74, Athaliza's sou,
William de Percy, by Richard of Dunsley, was Richard de Argentom de
Lofthcuse (see N o. 363), which gives colour to the supposition that there
was issue to the marriage of Walter ds Argentom and Athaliza There are
several other charters by members of the Argentum family, as connected
with Uplium or Upleatham‚ notably N os. 7 2, 217, and 422, the last of which
isin close connection with the present, ae well as with its grantor. The
memorandum printed ae No. 425 traces the descent of the Uplithum land
from the William de Argentum of the present charter through his three
grand-daughters 1ο their several husbands; but it is 1ο be observed that in
