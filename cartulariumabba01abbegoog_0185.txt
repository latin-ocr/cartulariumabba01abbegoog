Robert de Pothow‚ and others of like date, are co-witnesses with Robert de
Stntevill. What the relationship, however, between the said Robert de
Stnteville and the William de Stuteville of No. 73, may have been, though
nowhere hinted at in the present series of documenta, is apparentlya matter
01 tolerably direct inference. According to Dugdale‚ Robert de Stuteville 1.
was living in 1080 and 1107 ; 1110000,Βο11011 de Stuteville 11., was at the
battle of the Standard in 1138, was assessed to an aid 101 marrying the
King’s daughter in 1100, was Sheriff 01 Yorkshire 1170-117 5, and was still
living in 1177, 11 001, inferentially, 101 00100 time after that Robert 111. ,
son 01 Robert 1r., is merely mentioned, without any dates, 00 0 benefactor 01
Rievaulx3 but 11100011 William 10 named 00 taking an active part in publio
matters as early 00 1171, and 00 dying in 1204. Passing by the various
difficulties and perplexities involved in this statement, and especially as ool·
lated with the statements made in reference to these same noblemen by
Orderic Vitalis‚ 0000101 great (if any) intereat to the present inquiry‚ and
merely hinting in relation 1ο thern that it ’10 more than probable 1110110
10010 than one 011110 references the second and third Roberts are confounded
together, it remains to be noticed that the William de Stuteville last men-
tioned as dying in 1204-0 0010 which 1011100 well enough with that
necessarily given 10 No. 73,-0 direct lineal descendant, moreover‚ 01 1110
Robert de Stutevill named by Graves 00 grantor 01 Ayton, had two sons,
Robert and Nicbolas, by his wile Βο110, nieoe 01 Ranulph (10 Glanville. 01
these, Robert died ap, leaving his brother Nicholas his heir. This Robert
appears certainly to be the witness 10 the present deed, and the others
already noted as attested by him and Roger de Bosco. Moreovcr, it was
through J ohanna, the granddaughter 01 Nicholas just named, that the Ayton
property passed into the Wake family.

¹ The additional witnesses, 00 given in No. 348, are Reginald de Roselle,
liudulphus de Nevylle, Willelmus de Manteby (Maltby), Willelmus de
Tocots, Rogerus Persona de Semar, Thomas capellanus, Walter‘ de Hoton,
and Walter’ 00 Μο1100.

² The dedication of Goathland Ohurch isto S. Mary, and the probability
is that the “monitorium” 01 the Fratres endowed by Henry 1 (Νο. 191),
0110 who eventually commended themselves tc Whitby with that king’s
sanction, in order to become a cell 01 the Abbey 01 like order and babit, was
closely connected with the ancient parochial church. This deed must pro·
bably precede the commending 01 1110 Eremitorium 10 Whitby.
