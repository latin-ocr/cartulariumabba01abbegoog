years thus spent, he is further stated to have lost his llfe by an
accident, while assisting some workmen in the construction of a
bridge over the Derwent‚ at a place called Ormesbridge.

Symeon's narrative, however meagre in its details, up to the
period of Reinfrid’s death, is not inconsistent with all this.
He simply says that Reinfrid received those who, after his
arrival at Whitby‚ cameto him with the object of embracing a
monastic life ; adding this however at that point, that after his
death they removed to York, and founded there the Abbey of
St Mary's‚ “ which,'' he concludes, “is now energetically ruled
by Abbot Stephen.'' Α

But Stephen’s narrative would appear to be irreconcilably
inconsistent with this history3 indeed, directly contradictory in
some of its details. Before, however, proceeding to notice it
more precisely‚ it may be not inexpedient to try and ascertain
whether the charters themselves, or any among them, add any-
thing to our stook of information. And, at the outset, I remark
that, while there is no doubt that confirmato1y as well as
concessione] charters were granted hy William the Conqueror¹
to Whitby in Prior Serlo’s time—which, of course, assumes
previous granta and charters by one benefactor or more-there
is little reason to doubt that copy of at least one such charter,
conveying a grant to Prior Reinfrid, is extant. I referto the
charter by Hugh, Earl of Chester² (N o. 25), which occurs on f.7

¹ It must be remarked here that Young (Hoc. qs Whitby‚ p. 253) doubts
the existence of any charter by the Conqueror :-“ Wera we to suppose,
with Charlton, that the charter of King William, on the 47th leaf of the
Whitby Recistcr, is acharter of the Conqueror, then Serlo must have been
Prior before the year 1087. But that charter, compared with other
authentic documento, contains intrinsic evidence that it was obtained after
tha possessione of the Monastery were far more considerable than they were
in the conqueror's reign, and that it must therefore have been given by
William Rufus.” ButI think it will be seen as the inquiry proceeds that
Yonng had not duly examined the evidences which are available‚ and that it
is merely an unsupported assumption on his part that the possessions oi the
Monastery wera so inconsiderable in the conqueror’s time.

¹ Here again, attention must be claimed for Young’s commentary on the
charter noted in the text. ‘⁴ 'Phe authenticity of this charteris partly con-
firmed by ‘Domesday,' where we lind that Flaneburg or Flsmbrough belonged
so Farl Hugh ; yet it must be observed that no mention is madeof a church
there. independent of this circumstance, the chartaria a little suspicious,
