On the whole, I read the history of the renascent Monastery
somewhat in this way. At or near the date alleged—some
definite but not very long time before 1078-Reinfrid cameto
Whitby, and before long succeeded in collecting a body of
would-be Religious, having already, it may be, ascertained the
willingnesS, or more than willingness‚ of William de Percy to
sanction his undertaking and to further his objecta by leave and
licence to occupy the site of the ancient Monastery‚ if not by
aformal concession of the said site, its remains and appurten-
ances. But the concession, if it was not made at first, speedily
ensued‚ and a settlement, having at least more or less of regular
monastic form and order, was affected before the year 1080.
Reinfrid continued to act as superior of this monastic settle—
ment under the title of Prior for, at all events, some few years3
and under his Priorate certain accessione were made to the
lands and church already assigned to them, notably the church
or chapel of Middlesbrough and its tithes, the latter payable
out of a considerable district, and especially the Church of st.
Peter at Hackness, or, in other words, that attached to the old
monastic cell, which in old days had been a dependeucy or
appurtenance of the Whitby Monastery, and together with this,
two or more carucates of land in the same vill. During the
incumbency of Reinfrid, there is little or no doubt that Stephen,
the future Abbot of st. Mary’s at York‚ joined the community
or brotherhood‚ and being a man of sorne importance and
considerable capacity, 'conceived himself, and was conceived also
by a not insignificant party among the brethren, a suitablc
successor to Reinfrid when the career of the latter was cut short
by his accidental deathat Ormesbridge. The Percy family,
however, preferred that one of themselves should be promoted
to the vacant post, and probably in imitation or resentment at
this—possibly even under the impulses of ambition-Stephen
seceded from Whitby, and, makinga temporary halt at Lesting-
ham, eventually, and indeed only a short time afterwards,
became Abbot of York, and perhaps as a sort of peace-offering

had a grant, as such, of certain territory at Whitby, which, how-
ever, was such as not to interfere with the clrurch lands already
granted in free alins to Whitby, Serlo de Percy having become
