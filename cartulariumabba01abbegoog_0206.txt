Endowmeut obanter, appearing moreover in both copies 01 110 said charter
at the commencement of the chartulary, that in 1119 the fee in question
was in the hands 01 William Engelram, and the presumption is that he was
the father 01 John, who, in the confirmation by Peter de Brns 11. 01 all tha
donatione which the men 01 his les had suade 10 Gysburn‚ is named as the
given 01 the carucata specified in the Foundation charter. Probably this
implies more than merely a subsequent confirmation by John Yngelram*
rather that he united with his (1) father in the gift, or that the father died
so soon after the Foundation churter was executed that John Yngelrsm
became defucto the donor 01 110 carucste in question Contemporsry with
John Yngelram‚ at or about 1130-1135, wss Walterlngelram‚ sub-feudatory
01 Brus, as J ohn was st Arusum and Middlesburgh‚ st Ingelby Amoliffer, and
the question 01 relationship between them, as to its existence and its degree,
naturally suggests itself. Quite possibly they were brothers, a view not
discredited by the fact that Walter's son sud heir was also called Williau.
'lhat there was some connection between John aud Walter, whether that 01
brotherhood or not, is rendered more probable by the fact that Robertn
filius Ernisii, John Yngelram’s souin-law, is s witness to a chester to
R-ivaulx by Walter lugelram 01 Amcliff sud his mother Holdiarda-(Cott
