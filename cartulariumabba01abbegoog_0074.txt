appellabatur, nuno autem Witebi vocatur, Willelmus de Perci,
cognomento Lesgernuns, tempore Willelmi Bastard (nothi) Regis
Anglorum ibi fundaverit Monesterium in honore Sancti Petri
Apostoli et S. Hyldae Abbatissae, atque Reinfrido monacho de
Evesham cum sociis suis, quos sibi adquisiverat‚ ipsum locum
commendaverit, et primo duas carucatas terrae in Prestebi illi
tradidit.’'

Dr. Young, while remarking on one page¹ that “the
lands at Whitby,’' 11111111)τ “the six carucates 11 Presteby and
Soureby in the manor of Whitby,'' “were scarcely considered
as church property, being held by the Abbot Stephen as 1
vassal or tenant under the lord 01 that manor,’' at another²
makes “no doubt ’' that these “lands 01 Presteby and
Soureby in Whitby manor are the same which William de
Percy gave to Reinfrid and his fratemity,’' and more ex-
plicitly still, in a third place,3 adds, “The landa 01 Prestebi,
consisting 01 two carucates, 'are obviously the same which
William de Percy first gave to Reinfrid and his fraternity, 11
stated in the Memoria13 and unto these had been added the
lands 01 Sourebi (supposed to be Sneaton-Thorp), consisting 01
four oaruoates.” He omits, however, 10 notice the discrepancy
between the statement 01 his authority, the Memorialist‚ as 10
the nature 01 the gift to Reinfrid-“ in elemosinam perpetuam ''
-and thet 01 the tenure by the Abbot 01 York previously
noted by him. It would appear 10 me that the gift in free
alms to Reinfrid, and the grant in ordinary tenancy 10 the
Abbot 01 York, must be two distinct matters, and that the
lands concerned in either, at least most probably, must beas
distinct 11 the gift and grant themselves. That there was a
gist to Reinfrid there can be no doubt whatever, and, admitting
that gift, it must, in order to 111 validity, have been confirmed
bytho tenant 10 cupito, or Hugh 01 Ohester3 and yet further,
admitting the authenticity 01 the said Earl’s charter to Reinfrid
-and 101 doing so we have seen not simply wcighty, but I
think conclusive, reasons—then we must also admit not only
the grant. 01 the church 01 St. Peter but also 01 “ omnia qua ad
eam pertinent,” aud it will be hard, in the face 01 111 the pre·

ceding consideratione, to limit the meaning 01 this phrase so as
