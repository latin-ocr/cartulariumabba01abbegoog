Moreover, there is a further supposition which may be enter·
tained, and in this place, perhaps, without any incongruity, ol
such a nature as to connect itself with this last, and not with
any tendency to invalidate it. I mean that amid all tha
evident inconsistency with facts and with reason observed in
the alleged Stephen narrative, and in that supplied from
Dodsworth, there is one matter in which both agree, aa to ita
essential nature at all events, if not inita minor accensorias of
time and person.1 I refer to the alleged plundering attacks of
pirates from the sea and robbers from the more immediate
vicinity which, in the one account, induced the primary retreat
to Lestingeham‚ and in the other led to the retirement to

only bc aurmiaed. The lact, however, remaina that when the liat of feeain
Yorkahire, prefixed to the full specification of the variana mauors held by
the king and his several tenants ia capite, waa drawn up, the fourth in the
liat, the first three being “i. Terra Regis. ii. Archiepiacopi Ehoracenaia
et canonicorum ac hominum ejus. iii Ep'i Dnnelm. et hominum ejua.''
“iiii. Abbatis de Eboraco,” and next to it “v. Hugonis comitis.” In the tull
specification or description ol the manora involved aiter “i. Terra Regia,'’
and before “ ii. terra Archiep'i Eboraccnaia,’' are four entries under tha
rubricatad heading, not numbercd, of “Terra Archiap'i llborsc’.'' After
thia comes “iii Terra Ep'i Dnnelmensis,” and then “irii. Terra Hugonia
comitia '' instead ol “u Terra Hugonia comitia ’' aa in the pretatory liat or
index. It ia to be preaumed that the liat was made before tha specification
was completed, and suffered to remain unaltered by an overaight3 butenen
ao it eoncluaively shows that the fea of the Abbot oi York was in acme
aenae an entity even then, though not an entity ec postfacto aa all the other
twentyeight fees named in the liat wera-that is, aa being already enjoyed
by the several grantees named. In all probability tha antity of the Abbot’a
ise was dependent on the circumstance that it was in processui formation,
but not as yet fully formed, and that a variety of adjuatmenta, releaaca,
regrants, exchangea‚ or granta in augmentation having to be made belorea
final arrangement could be come to, it was found impossible, within tha
limited time allowed by the urgent demanda of the king for the complated
returns, to give the necessary details, ete, tha Abbot's iae was finally
omitted aa a several or special fea. Aa to the adjustmanta, ra-leaaas, ra·
granta, eta, just named, aorne explanatory matter will be found in tha text
at a subsequent page.

pirates and robbers, and that in his own time and ta Leatinghann The
Dodsworth authority speaks ol two perioda ol auch attacks, one in the tima
of Prior Reinirid, theotheria that of Serlo, which latter witnessed tha
retreat to Hackneaa.
