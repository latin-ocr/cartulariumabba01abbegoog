Roger de Moubray); a sixth belonging to Whitby itself in
Midelesburg3³ three more of Alvered’s fec (held of Brus) in
Aelum; atenth‚ also in Aelum, of Robsrt Esturmith's fee3 an
eleventh ol Malet's fee (and, like the last, held ol Brus); and
the twellth, in Arusum, belonging to Gysebusn itself, and
derived from the same benefactor. These places are all part
and parcel of the manerium of Aelum, which not only includes
Midlesburg and its appertaining vills, but is also noted in
Domesday as constituting part ol the fee of the Earl of Oheetem
and, besides this, an equitable partition and settlement having
been agreed upon between the contending parties, the monks of
Whitby “clamaverunt quietum et solutum '' to the canons of
Gyseburn “ quicquid poterant calumpniare adversus parrochias
illorum ''-necessarily those affected by the said equitable par-
tition and settlement-“ propter docum Hayoac'e Oetaeae
Comitis? It appears to be transparently clear that, when the

¹ The presumption-if not, indeed, the certainty-is that John Ingram
was a subfeudatory oi Brus. The confirmation by Peter de Brns 11. of all
the donatiam of his “men’' within his fee, by mentioning William Engelram
as lord of the lands in Arusum, is all but conclusive. Arnald de Pcrci held
some land in Arnum, but not much, and it is certain that the Kildale
Percies not only originally, but mainly, held under Brus.

bhree carucates in Tollesbi, one in Aclum, two in Stainton‚ and one and a half
in Tormczbi (Thornaby), all ia capite. But although the quantitiesspecified
in the Brus fee in the places here named are suspiclously elika-cg. in
Tollesbi, three cernentes, in Tormozbi‚ one and a half-it is difficult to oon·
ceive of any transference irom the Melet ¹fee to the Brus iae before 1086
(whatever of the kind may have happened in the lat and ad of Hem-y 1.)‚
and still more tc account for the lordship oi Roger de Moubray, supposing
such transference to have taken place. Itis at least possible that this
carucata in Levingthorp-a vill not separately mentioned in Domcsday, but
with Arusum (also unmentioned) included in the Manerium of Aelum-was ·
a part of the smaller manor in Aolum included in the Domesday Recordin
