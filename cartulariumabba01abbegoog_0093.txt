Prior in the room of Reinfrid. Further concessione of property
were obtained for the Conveni, just as some additions had
been made when he took upon himself the monkish profession,
and the renascent Monastery and its head became invested-
notwithstanding certain temporary ohecks sustained, at probably

an early period 61 Serlo’s presidency‚ under the attacks 61 one
or more bodies 61 marauders, which compelled 6 temporary
retreat to the Hackness cell-‚with considerable influence end
prestige. And it was when this was so that William de Perci
the Founder, animated hythe same religione fervour which
sent him forth as a orusader to meet his fatain the Holy Land,
conceived the idea, in its practical form, of elevating what had
been hitherto merely a somewhat unimportant Priory into a
well-endowed and influential Abbey; and his own granta and
donations being largely supplemented by others from various
members of his family, and from a number 61 his “ homines ”
or sub-infeudatories, the proposed change was effected‚ and
William de Perey, nephew of the Founder a'nd 61 Prior Serio,

writers, living probably some generations afterwards, about the
variance between the brothers Williamand Serlo, and the perse·
cution the latter was supposed to have undergone at the hands
61 his powerful, and, as alleged, unscrupulous brother,-a man
whose last recorded action is, notwithstanding, a munificent
deed of gift to the aelf-same persecuted Prior and his monks.

in the first column are those given by Β1111611,1 and that it is
by no means clear in several cases whether they are the dates
