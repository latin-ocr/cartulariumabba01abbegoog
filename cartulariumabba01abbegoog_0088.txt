place of a Priory, and endow it with accordant liberality‚ may
have been, probably were, cotemporaneous‚ or, at all events, due
10 the same religious impulse. And there are certainly features
in the charter which seem 10 baspeak the presence of more than
usual earnestness and solemnity 111 the grantor’s mind and
intention. The Arohbishop himself, besides the Founder's wife,
his heir, also two more 01 his sons (Walter, the second, and
William, the canon), his near kinsman, Ernald 1110 founder 01
the Kildale family, Gilbert fitz Adelard (witness to the Earl of
Chester’s charter), are all present, and all—at least all the mem-
bers of the family named, and especially the Primate in his
ecclesiastical capacity-formally joining with himself in the
grant, concession, and confirmation of the lordly gift :—“ Huic
dono affuerunt testes et concessores Thomas Archiepiscopus
Ebor’, Emma de Port uxor mea, Alanus, Walterus, WillelmuS,
filii mei‚’' 010. Surely no occasion can be imagined more suited
10 call forth such unusual manifestation, on the part 01 0 great
benefactor, 01 011 00111001 solicitude that his granta should have
every possible sanction, and especially 011 the part 01 those most
nearly concemed in the lands and possessicns proposed 10 be,
and now actually and formally, alienated, than 0110 011 which
the said benefactor stood on the verge of an enterprise in which,
advanced in years as he already was, he was about to exposa
himself tc all the perils of travel and hardship, sickness and
warfare, and from which, humanly speaking, the chauces 01 his
return in safety could scarcely, in any sense, be considered
hopeful¹

But there 10 01111 another point in the charter to which atten-
tion should be given—I mean the terma in which the object for
which theold granta are confirmed, and so largely augmented
by new—namely, “ad fundandam Abbatiam olim destructam’'
-for the refounding of the Abbacy long ago destroyed. The
fact being that, unquestionably within the four years next
succeeding our supposed date, the Priory was exchanged for

¹ Of 0011100 there is an opening for tha suggestion that the impulse under
which William de Porci was acting, alike in assuming the Oross and 01111011-
ing the Abbacy with augmented gifts, may have been cognate with that
already adverted to in the 11010 10 p. lxxviii, in speaking 01 Nigel de Albini’s
restoration of the hall carucate of land at Thorp to the All Saints Call at
York. In other words, religious compunction, in whatever way excited,
may be supposed aa the actuating influeres in William dc Perci's beart.
