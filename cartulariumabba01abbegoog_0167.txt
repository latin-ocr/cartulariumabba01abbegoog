el the point to observa that, in a side-note in the list of the knights of the
Perey fee adverted to above, William de Argentum is alleged to have held his
one knight’s fee partly in Uplium and partly in Lofthus‚ as also that in Burton
(Mon. Il'bor. p. 353), William de Argentin is stated to have given land in
Uplium to Gyseburn with the consent of Julian, his wife, and Roget and
Agnes, their son and daughter. This confirma the memorandum as to Wil-
liam's son Roger. It is probable also that the Percys had an interest in
Ugthorpe, as the name Percybiggyng is one which occurs in the Gysburne
charters in connection with Ugthorpe, and this may indicate the site of the
land held there by the Argentoms and of the Pereys. ¹ M. Uplium.
² The word which follows Regis is unintelligible. It looks like iomss or
ioniss‚ the first a being a long one.
³ “The Whitsuntide of 1170 was however marked by a more critical
event than the inquest of Sheriffs. The heir was crowned as Henry111.;
the ceremony was performed, not by Thomas ci (lanterbury but by Roger of
York, and the wife oi the young king was not crowned with him. This
act, which was intended by Henry as a sign and seal of power, was a most
rrnfortunate mistake. He had, not unnaturally, supposed that it would
strengthen the supreme authority to have in each division of his dominicus
asufficient representative of royal majesty, he found that he had planeda
dangerous weapon in the hands of an undutiful scn3 the minor irregularities
of the coronaticn day roused his enemies to henzy3 Thomas Becket asserted
that the rights oi Canterbury‚ of the English charon, of Christianity itself‚
were outraged by Archbishop Roger³s intrusion 3 and Lewis vm, burt at the
neglect of his daughter, and backed by the support or the family of Cham-
pagne‚ who combined careful orthodoxy with intense hatred of the house of
Anien, urged the Pope to put the kingdom under interdict.”—(Stubbs's
